is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.\ncontainerd is a member of CNCF with 'graduated' status.\ncontainerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users.\n\nAnnouncements\nHello Kubernetes v1.24!\nThe containerd project would like to announce containerd v1.6.4. While other prior releases are supported, this latest release and the containerd v1.5.11 release are recommended for Kubernetes v1.24.\nWe felt it important to announce this, particularly in view of the dockershim removal from this release of Kubernetes.\nIt should be noted here that moving to CRI integrations has been in the plan for many years.  containerd began as part of Docker and was donated to CNCF. containerd remains in use today by Docker/moby/buildkit etc., and has many other adopters. containerd has a namespace that isolates use of containerd from various clients/adopters. The Kubernetes namespace is appropriately named k8s.io. The CRI API and containerd CRI plugin project has, from the start, been an effort to reduce the impact surface for Kubernetes container runtime integration. If you can't tell, we are excited to see this come to fruition.\nIf you have any concerns or questions, we will be here to answer them in issues, discussions, and/or on slack. Below you will find information/detail about our CRI Integration implementation.\nFor containerd users already on v1.6.0-v1.6.3, there are known issues addressed by v1.6.4. The issues are primarily related to CNI setup\nNow Recruiting\nWe are a large inclusive OSS project that is welcoming help of any kind shape or form:\n\nDocumentation help is needed to make the product easier to consume and extend.\nWe need OSS community outreach/organizing help to get the word out; manage\nand create messaging and educational content; and help with social media, community forums/groups, and google groups.\nWe are actively inviting new security advisors to join the team.\nNew subprojects are being created, core and non-core that could use additional development help.\nEach of the containerd projects has a list of issues currently being worked on or that need help resolving.\nIf the issue has not already been assigned to someone or has not made recent progress, and you are interested, please inquire.\nIf you are interested in starting with a smaller/beginner-level issue, look for issues with an exp/beginner tag, for example containerd/containerd beginner issues.\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nSee our documentation on containerd.io:\n\nfor ops and admins\nnamespaces\nclient options\n\nSee how to build containerd from source at BUILDING.\nIf you are interested in trying out containerd see our example at Getting Started.\nNightly builds\nThere are nightly builds available for download here.\nBinaries are generated from main branch every night for Linux and Windows.\nPlease be aware: nightly builds might have critical bugs, it's not recommended for use in production and no support provided.\nKubernetes (k8s) CI Dashboard Group\nThe k8s CI dashboard group for containerd contains test results regarding\nthe health of kubernetes when run against main and a number of containerd release branches.\n\ncontainerd-periodics\n\nRuntime Requirements\nRuntime requirements for containerd are very minimal. Most interactions with\nthe Linux and Windows container feature sets are handled via runc and/or\nOS-specific libraries (e.g. hcsshim for Microsoft).\nThe current required version of runc is described in RUNC.md.\nThere are specific features\nused by containerd core code and snapshotters that will require a minimum kernel\nversion on Linux. With the understood caveat of distro kernel versioning, a\nreasonable starting point for Linux is a minimum 4.x kernel version.\nThe overlay filesystem snapshotter, used by default, uses features that were\nfinalized in the 4.x kernel series. If you choose to use btrfs, there may\nbe more flexibility in kernel version (minimum recommended is 3.18), but will\nrequire the btrfs kernel module and btrfs tools to be installed on your Linux\ndistribution.\nTo use Linux checkpoint and restore features, you will need criu installed on\nyour system. See more details in Checkpoint and Restore.\nBuild requirements for developers are listed in BUILDING.\nSupported Registries\nAny registry which is compliant with the OCI Distribution Specification\nis supported by containerd.\nFor configuring registries, see registry host configuration documentation\nFeatures\nClient\ncontainerd offers a full client package to help you integrate containerd into your platform.\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n\n  \"github.com/containerd/containerd\"\n  \"github.com/containerd/containerd/cio\"\n  \"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces\"\n)\n\n\nfunc main() {\n    client, err := containerd.New(\"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\")\n    defer client.Close()\n}\n\nNamespaces\nNamespaces allow multiple consumers to use the same containerd without conflicting with each other.  It has the benefit of sharing content while maintaining separation with containers and images.\nTo set a namespace for requests to the API:\ncontext = context.Background()\n// create a context for docker\ndocker = namespaces.WithNamespace(context, \"docker\")\n\ncontainerd, err := client.NewContainer(docker, \"id\")\n\nTo set a default namespace on the client:\nclient, err := containerd.New(address, containerd.WithDefaultNamespace(\"docker\"))\n\nDistribution\n// pull an image\nimage, err := client.Pull(context, \"docker.io/library/redis:latest\")\n\n// push an image\nerr := client.Push(context, \"docker.io/library/redis:latest\", image.Target())\n\nContainers\nIn containerd, a container is a metadata object. Resources such as an OCI runtime specification, image, root filesystem, and other metadata can be attached to a container.\nredis, err := client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\")\ndefer redis.Delete(context)\n\nOCI Runtime Specification\ncontainerd fully supports the OCI runtime specification for running containers.  We have built-in functions to help you generate runtime specifications based on images as well as custom parameters.\nYou can specify options when creating a container about how to modify the specification.\nredis, err := client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\", containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)))\n\nRoot Filesystems\ncontainerd allows you to use overlay or snapshot filesystems with your containers.  It comes with built-in support for overlayfs and btrfs.\n// pull an image and unpack it into the configured snapshotter\nimage, err := client.Pull(context, \"docker.io/library/redis:latest\", containerd.WithPullUnpack)\n\n// allocate a new RW root filesystem for a container based on the image\nredis, err := client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\",\n    containerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"redis-rootfs\", image),\n    containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),\n)\n\n// use a readonly filesystem with multiple containers\nfor i := 0; i \nTasks\nTaking a container object and turning it into a runnable process on a system is done by creating a new Task from the container.  A task represents the runnable object within containerd.\n// create a new task\ntask, err := redis.NewTask(context, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))\ndefer task.Delete(context)\n\n// the task is now running and has a pid that can be used to setup networking\n// or other runtime settings outside of containerd\npid := task.Pid()\n\n// start the redis-server process inside the container\nerr := task.Start(context)\n\n// wait for the task to exit and get the exit status\nstatus, err := task.Wait(context)\n\nCheckpoint and Restore\nIf you have criu installed on your machine you can checkpoint and restore containers and their tasks.  This allows you to clone and/or live migrate containers to other machines.\n// checkpoint the task then push it to a registry\ncheckpoint, err := task.Checkpoint(context)\n\nerr := client.Push(context, \"myregistry/checkpoints/redis:master\", checkpoint)\n\n// on a new machine pull the checkpoint and restore the redis container\ncheckpoint, err := client.Pull(context, \"myregistry/checkpoints/redis:master\")\n\nredis, err = client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\", containerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"redis-rootfs\", checkpoint))\ndefer container.Delete(context)\n\ntask, err = redis.NewTask(context, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio), containerd.WithTaskCheckpoint(checkpoint))\ndefer task.Delete(context)\n\nerr := task.Start(context)\n\nSnapshot Plugins\nIn addition to the built-in Snapshot plugins in containerd, additional external\nplugins can be configured using GRPC. An external plugin is made available using\nthe configured name and appears as a plugin alongside the built-in ones.\nTo add an external snapshot plugin, add the plugin to containerd's config file\n(by default at /etc/containerd/config.toml). The string following\nproxy_plugin. will be used as the name of the snapshotter and the address\nshould refer to a socket with a GRPC listener serving containerd's Snapshot\nGRPC API.

To use the autocomplete feature in a bash shell for example, source\nthe autocomplete/ctr file in your .bashrc, or manually like:\n$ source ./contrib/autocomplete/ctr\nDistribution of ctr autocomplete for bash and zsh\nFor bash, copy the contrib/autocomplete/ctr script into\n/etc/bash_completion.d/ and rename it to ctr. The zsh_autocomplete\nfile is also available and can be used similarly for zsh users.\nProvide documentation to users to source this file into their shell if\nyou don't place the autocomplete file in a location where it is automatically\nloaded for the user's shell environment.\nCRI\ncri is a containerd plugin implementation of the Kubernetes container runtime interface (CRI). With it, you are able to use containerd as the container runtime for a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nCRI Status\ncri is a native plugin of containerd. Since containerd 1.1, the cri plugin is built into the release binaries and enabled by default.\n\nNote: As of containerd 1.5, the cri plugin is merged into the containerd/containerd repo. For example, the source code previously stored under containerd/cri/pkg\nwas moved to containerd/containerd/pkg/cri package.\n\nThe cri plugin has reached GA status, representing that it is:\n\nFeature complete\nWorks with Kubernetes 1.10 and above\nPasses all CRI validation tests.\nPasses all node e2e tests.\nPasses all e2e tests.\n\nSee results on the containerd k8s test dashboard\nValidating Your cri Setup\nA Kubernetes incubator project, cri-tools, includes programs for exercising CRI implementations.

Containerd operates on the same node as the Kubelet. The cri plugin inside containerd handles all CRI service requests from the Kubelet and uses containerd internals to manage containers and container images.\nThe cri plugin uses containerd to manage the full container lifecycle and all container images. As also shown below, cri manages pod networking via CNI (another CNCF project).\n\nLet's use an example to demonstrate how the cri plugin works for the case when Kubelet creates a single-container pod:\n\nKubelet calls the cri plugin, via the CRI runtime service API, to create a pod;\ncri creates the pod’s network namespace, and then configures it using CNI;\ncri uses containerd internal to create and start a special pause container (the sandbox container) and put that container inside the pod’s cgroups and namespace (steps omitted for brevity);\nKubelet subsequently calls the cri plugin, via the CRI image service API, to pull the application container image;\ncri further uses containerd to pull the image if the image is not present on the node;\nKubelet then calls cri, via the CRI runtime service API, to create and start the application container inside the pod using the pulled container image;\ncri finally uses containerd internal to create the application container, put it inside the pod’s cgroups and namespace, then to start the pod’s new application container.\nAfter these steps, a pod and its corresponding application container is created and running.\n\n"},"cri/config.html":{"url":"cri/config.html","title":"Config","keywords":"","body":"CRI Plugin Config Guide\nThis document provides the description of the CRI plugin configuration.\nThe CRI plugin config is part of the containerd config (default\npath: /etc/containerd/config.toml).\nSee here\nfor more information about containerd config.\nNote that the [plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\"] section is specific to CRI,\nand not recognized by other containerd clients such as ctr, nerdctl, and Docker/Moby.\nBasic configuration\nCgroup Driver\nWhile containerd and Kubernetes use the legacy cgroupfs driver for managing cgroups by default,\nit is recommended to use the systemd driver on systemd-based hosts for compliance of\nthe \"single-writer\" rule of cgroups.\nTo configure containerd to use the systemd driver, set the following option in /etc/containerd/config.toml:\nversion = 2\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.runc.options]\n  SystemdCgroup = true\n\nIn addition to containerd, you have to configure the KubeletConfiguration to use the \"systemd\" cgroup driver.\nThe KubeletConfiguration is typically located at /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml:\nkind: KubeletConfiguration\napiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\ncgroupDriver: \"systemd\"\n\nkubeadm users should also see the kubeadm documentation.\nSnapshotter\nThe default snapshotter is set to overlayfs (akin to Docker's overlay2 storage driver):\nversion = 2\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd]\n  snapshotter = \"overlayfs\"\n\nSee here for other supported snapshotters.\nRuntime classes\nThe following example registers custom runtimes into containerd:\nversion = 2\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd]\n  default_runtime_name = \"crun\"\n  [plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes]\n    #

Set\nconfig_path = \"/etc/containerd/certs.d\" in your config.toml for containerd.\nMake a directory tree at the config path that includes docker.io as a directory\nrepresenting the host namespace to be configured. Then add a hosts.toml file\nin the docker.io to configure the host namespace. It should look like this:\n$ tree /etc/containerd/certs.d\n/etc/containerd/certs.d\n└── docker.io\n    └── hosts.toml\n\n$ cat /etc/containerd/certs.d/docker.io/hosts.toml\nserver = \"https://docker.io\"\n\n[host.\"https://registry-1.docker.io\"]\n  capabilities = [\"pull\", \"resolve\"]\nTo specify a custom certificate:\n$ cat /etc/containerd/certs.d/192.168.12.34:5000/hosts.toml\nserver = \"https://192.168.12.34:5000\"\n\n[host.\"https://192.168.12.34:5000\"]\n  ca = \"/path/to/ca.crt\"\nSee docs/hosts.md for the further information.\nUntrusted Workload\nThe recommended way to run untrusted workload is to use\nRuntimeClass api\nintroduced in Kubernetes 1.12 to select RuntimeHandlers configured to run\nuntrusted workload in plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.\nHowever, if you are using the legacy io.kubernetes.cri.untrusted-workloadpod annotation\nto request a pod be run using a runtime for untrusted workloads, the RuntimeHandler\nplugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\"cri.containerd.runtimes.untrusted must be defined first.\nWhen the annotation io.kubernetes.cri.untrusted-workload is set to true the untrusted\nruntime will be used. For example, see\nCreate an untrusted pod using Kata Containers.\nCNI Config Template\nIdeally the cni config should be placed by system admin or cni daemon like calico, weaveworks etc.\nHowever, this is useful for the cases when there is no cni daemonset to place cni config.\nThe cni config template uses the golang\ntemplate format. Currently supported\nvalues are:\n\n.PodCIDR is a string of the first CIDR assigned to the node.\n.PodCIDRRanges is a string array of all CIDRs assigned to the node. It is\nusually used for\ndualstack support.\n.Routes is a string array of all routes needed. It is usually used for\ndualstack support or single stack but IPv4 or IPv6 is decided at runtime.\n\nThe golang template actions\ncan be used to render the cni config. For example, you can use the following\ntemplate to add CIDRs and routes for dualstack in the CNI config:\n\"ipam\": {\n  \"type\": \"host-local\",\n  \"ranges\": [{{range $i, $range := .PodCIDRRanges}}{{if $i}}, {{end}}[{\"subnet\": \"{{$range}}\"}]{{end}}],\n  \"routes\": [{{range $i, $route := .Routes}}{{if $i}}, {{end}}{\"dst\": \"{{$route}}\"}{{end}}]\n}\nDeprecation\nThe config options of the CRI plugin follow the Kubernetes deprecation\npolicy of \"admin-facing CLI components\".\nIn summary, when a config option is announced to be deprecated:\n\nIt is kept functional for 6 months or 1 release (whichever is longer);\nA warning is emitted when it is used.\n\n"},"cri/crictl.html":{"url":"cri/crictl.html","title":"Crictl","keywords":"","body":"CRICTL User Guide\nThis document presumes you already have containerd with the cri plugin installed and running.\nThis document is for developers who wish to debug, inspect, and manage their pods,\ncontainers, and container images.\nBefore generating issues against this document, containerd, containerd/cri,\nor crictl please make sure the issue has not already been submitted.\nInstall crictl\nIf you have not already installed crictl please install the version compatible\nwith the cri plugin you are using.

container image decryption for containerd for use with the cri plugin.\nEncrypted Container Images\nEncrypted container images are OCI images which contain encrypted blobs. These encrypted images can be created through the use of containerd/imgcrypt project. To decrypt these images, the containerd runtime uses information passed from the cri such as keys, options and encryption metadata.\nThe \"node\" Key Model\nEncryption ties trust to an entity based on the model in which a key is associated with it. We call this the key model. One such usecase is when we want to tie the trust of a key to the node in a cluster. In this case, we call it the \"node\" or \"host\" Key Model. Future work will include more key models to facilitate other trust associations (i.e. for multi-tenancy).\n\"node\" Key Model Usecase\nIn this model encryption is tied to worker nodes. The usecase here revolves around the idea that an image should be decryptable only on trusted host. Using this model, various node based technologies which help bootstrap trust in worker nodes and perform secure key distribution (i.e. TPM, host attestation, secure/measured boot). In this scenario, runtimes are capable of fetching the necessary decryption keys. An example of this is using the --decryption-keys-path flag in imgcrypt.\nConfiguring image decryption for \"node\" key model\nThis is the default model since containerd v1.5.\nFor containerd v1.4, you need to add the following configuration to /etc/containerd/config.toml and restart the containerd service manually.\nversion = 2\n\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".image_decryption]\n  key_model = \"node\"\n\n[stream_processors]\n  [stream_processors.\"io.containerd.ocicrypt.decoder.v1.tar.gzip\"]\n    accepts = [\"application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip+encrypted\"]\n    returns = \"application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip\"\n    path = \"ctd-decoder\"\n    args = [\"--decryption-keys-path\", \"/etc/containerd/ocicrypt/keys\"]\n    env= [\"OCICRYPT_KEYPROVIDER_CONFIG=/etc/containerd/ocicrypt/ocicrypt_keyprovider.conf\"]\n  [stream_processors.\"io.containerd.ocicrypt.decoder.v1.tar\"]\n    accepts = [\"application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+encrypted\"]\n    returns = \"application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar\"\n    path = \"ctd-decoder\"\n    args = [\"--decryption-keys-path\", \"/etc/containerd/ocicrypt/keys\"]\n    env= [\"OCICRYPT_KEYPROVIDER_CONFIG=/etc/containerd/ocicrypt/ocicrypt_keyprovider.conf\"]\n\nIn this example, container image decryption is set to use the \"node\" key model.\nIn addition, the decryption stream_processors are configured as specified in containerd/imgcrypt project, with the additional field --decryption-keys-path configured to specify where decryption keys are located locally in the node.\nThe $OCICRYPT_KEYPROVIDER_CONFIG environment variable is used for ocicrypt keyprovider protocol.\n"},"cri/installation.html":{"url":"cri/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"This documentation was merged into ../getting-started.md.\nPlease update your bookmark.\n\n\n\nShow the original content (DEPRECATED)\n\n\n\n# Install Containerd with Release Tarball\nThis document provides the steps to install `containerd` and its dependencies with the release tarball, and bring up a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.\n\nThese steps have been verified on Ubuntu 16.04.

As shown below, it creates a containerd-shim for each container, and the shim manages the lifecycle of its corresponding container.\n\nIn Dec. 2016, Docker Inc. spun it out into a standalone component, and donated it to CNCF in Mar. 2017.\nMotivation\nContainerd is one potential alternative to Docker as the runtime for Kubernetes clusters. Compared with Docker, containerd has pros and cons.\nPros\n\nStability: Containerd has limited scope and slower feature velocity, which is expected to be more stable.\nCompatibility: The scope of containerd aligns with Kubernetes' requirements. It provides the required functionalities and the flexibility for areas like image pulling, networking, volume and logging etc.\nPerformance:\nContainerd consumes less resource than Docker at least because it's a subset of Docker;\nContainerd CRI integration eliminates an extra hop in the stack (as shown below). \n\n\nNeutral Foundation: Containerd is part of CNCF now.Cons\n\nUser Adoption:\nIdeally, Kubernetes users don't interact with the underlying container runtime directly. However, for the lack of debug toolkits, sometimes users still need to login the node to debug with Docker CLI directly.\nContainerd provides barebone CLIs ctr and dist for development and debugging purpose, but they may not be sufficient and necessary. Additionally, presuming these are sufficient and necessary tools, a plan and time would be needed to sufficiently document these CLIs and educate users in their use.\n\n\nMaturity: The rescoped containerd is pretty new, and it's still under heavy development.Goals\n\nMake sure containerd meets the requirement of Kubernetes, now and into the foreseeable future.\nImplement containerd CRI shim and make sure it provides equivalent functionality, usability and debuggability.\nImprove Kubernetes by taking advantage of the flexibility provided by containerd.Design\nThe following sections discuss the design aspects of the containerd CRI integration. For the purposes of this doc, the containerd CRI integration will be referred to as CRI-containerd.Container Lifecycle\nCRI-containerd relies on containerd to manage container lifecycle.\n\nIdeally, CRI-containerd only needs to do api translation and information reorganization. However, CRI-containerd needs to maintain some metadata because:\n\nThere is a mismatch between container lifecycle of CRI and containerd - containerd only tracks running processes, once the container and it's corresponding containerd-shim exit, the container is no longer visible in the containerd API.\nSome sandbox/container metadata is not provided by containerd, and we can not leverage OCI runtime annotation to store it because of the container lifecycle mismatch, e.g. labels/annotations, PodSandboxID of a container, FinishedAt timestamp, ExitCode, Mounts etc.\n\nCRI-containerd should checkpoint these metadata itself or use containerd metadata service if available.\nContainer Logging\nContainerd doesn't provide persistent container log. It redirects container STDIO into different FIFOs.\nCRI-containerd should start a goroutine (process/container in the future) to:\n\nContinuously drain the FIFO;\nDecorate the log line into CRI-defined format;\nWrite the log into CRI-defined log path.Container Streaming\nContainerd supports creating a process in the container with Exec, and the STDIO is also exposed as FIFOs. Containerd also supports resizing console of a specific process with Pty.\n\nCRI-containerd could reuse the streaming server, it should implement the streaming runtime interface.\nFor different CRI streaming functions:\n\nExecSync: CRI-containerd should use Exec to create the exec process, collect the stdout/stderr of the process, and wait for the process to terminate.\nExec: CRI-containerd should use Exec to create the exec process, create a goroutine (process/container) to redirect streams, and wait for the process to terminate.\nAttach: CRI-containerd should create a goroutine (process/container) to read the existing container log to the output, redirect streams of the init process, and wait for any stream to be closed.\nPortForward: CRI-containerd could implement this with socat and nsenter, similar with current Docker portforward implementation.Container Networking\nContainerd doesn't provide container networking, but OCI runtime spec supports joining a linux container into an existing network namespace.\n\nCRI-containerd should:\n\nCreate a network namespace for a sandbox;\nCall network plugin to update the options of the network namespace;\nLet the user containers in the same sandbox share the network namespace.Container Metrics\nContainerd provides container cgroup metrics, and plans to provide container writable layer disk usage.\n\nCRI container metrics api needs to be defined (#27097). After that, CRI-containerd should translate containerd container metrics into CRI container metrics.\nImage Management\nCRI-containerd relies on containerd to manage images. Containerd should provide all function and information required by CRI, and CRI-containerd only needs to do api translation and information reorganization.\nImageFS Metrics\nContainerd plans to provide image filesystem metrics.\nCRI image filesystem metrics needs to be defined (#33048). After that, we should make sure containerd provides the required metrics, and CRI-containerd should translate containerd image filesystem metrics into CRI image filesystem metrics.\nOut of Scope\nFollowing items are out of the scope of this design, we may address them in future version as enhancement or optimization.\n\nDebuggability: One of the biggest concern of CRI-containerd is debuggability. We should provide equivalent debuggability with Docker CLI through kubectl, cri-tools or containerd CLI.\nBuilt-in CRI support: The plugin model provided by containerd makes it possible to directly build CRI support into containerd as a plugin, which will eliminate one more hop from the stack. But because of the limitation of golang plugin, we have to either maintain our own branch or push CRI plugin upstream.\nSeccomp: (#36997) Seccomp is supported in OCI runtime spec. However, current seccomp implementation in Kubernetes is experimental and docker specific, the api needs to be defined in CRI first before CRI-containerd implements it.\nStreaming server authentication: (#36666) CRI-containerd will be out-of-process with Kubelet, so it could not reuse Kubelet authentication. Its streaming server should implement its own authentication mechanism.\nMove container facilities into pod cgroup: Container facilities including container image puller, container streaming handler, log handler and containerd-shim serve a specific container. They should be moved to the corresponding pod cgroup, and the overhead introduced by them should be charged to the pod.\nLog rotation: (#42718) Container log rotation is under design. A function may be added in CRI to signal the runtime to reopen log file. CRI-containerd should implement that function after it is defined.\nExec container: With the flexibility provided by containerd, it is possible to implement Exec with a separate container sharing the same rootfs and mount namespace with the original container. The advantage is that the Exec container could have it's own sub-cgroup, so that it will not consume the resource of application container and user could specify dedicated resource for it.\nAdvanced image management: The image management interface in CRI is relatively simple because the requirement of Kubelet image management is not clearly scoped out. In the future, we may want to leverage the flexibility provided by containerd more, e.g. estimate image size before pulling etc.\n...Roadmap and Milestones\nMilestones\nKubernetes 1.7 - Q2\n\n[P0] Basic container lifecycle.\n[P0] Basic image management.\n[P0] Container networking.\n[P1] Container streaming/logging.\n[P2] Container/ImageFS Metrics.\n\nTest Plan: Each feature added should have unit test and pass its corresponding cri validation test.\nKubernetes 1.8 - Q3\n\n[P0] Feature complete, pass 100% cri validation test.\n[P0] Integrate CRI-containerd with Kubernetes, and build the e2e/node e2e test framework.\n[P1] Address the debuggability problem.Q2 Roadmap\n|               Item               | 1/2 Mar. | 2/2 Mar. | 1/2 Apr. | 2/2 Apr. | 1/2 May. | 2/2 May. |\n|:--------------------------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n|              Survey              |     ✓    |          |          |          |          |          |\n|                POC               |          |     ✓    |          |          |          |          |\n|             Proposal             |          |          |     ✓    |          |          |          |\n|    Containerd Feature Complete   |     ✓    |     ✓    |     ✓    |          |          |          |\n|  Runtime Management Integration  |          |          |     ✓    |     ✓    |     ✓    |     ✓    |\n|   Image Management Integration   |          |          |          |     ✓    |     ✓    |     ✓    |\n| Container Networking Integration |          |          |          |          |     ✓    |     ✓    |\n\n"},"historical/design/architecture.html":{"url":"historical/design/architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nTo ensure clean separation of concerns, we have organized the units of\ncontainerd's behavior into components. Components are roughly organized\ninto subsystems. Components that bridge subsystems may be referred to as\nmodules. Modules typically provide cross-cutting functionality, such as\npersistent storage or event distribution. Understanding these components and\ntheir relationships is key to modifying and extending the system.\nThis document will cover very high-level interaction. For details on each\nmodule, please see the relevant design document.\nThe main goal of this architecture is to coordinate the creation and execution\nof bundles.  Bundles contain configuration, metadata and root filesystem\ndata and are consumed by the runtime. A bundle is the on-disk\nrepresentation of a runtime container. Bundles are mutable and can be passed\nto other systems for modification or packed up and distributed. In practice, it\nis simply a directory on the filesystem. \n\nNote that while these architectural ideas are important to understand the\nsystem, code layout may not reflect the exact architecture. These ideas should\nbe used as a guide for placing functionality and behavior and understanding the\nthought behind the design.\nSubsystems\nExternal users interact with services, made available via a GRPC API.\n\nBundle: The bundle service allows the user to extract and pack bundles\nfrom disk images.\nRuntime: The runtime service supports the execution of bundles,\nincluding the creation of runtime containers.\n\nTypically, each subsystem will have one or more related controller components\nthat implement the behavior of the subsystem. The behavior of the subsystem\nmay be exported for access via corresponding services.\nModules\nIn addition to the subsystems, we have several components that may cross\nsubsystem boundaries, referenced to as components. We have the following\ncomponents:\n\nExecutor: The executor implements the actual container runtime.\nSupervisor: The supervisor monitors and reports container state.\nMetadata: Stores metadata in a graph database. Use to store any\npersistent references to images and bundles. Data entered into the\ndatabase will have schemas coordinated between components to provide access\nto arbitrary data. Other functionality includes hooks for garbage collection\nof on-disk resources.\nContent: Provides access to content addressable storage. All immutable\ncontent will be stored here, keyed by content hash.\nSnapshot: Manages filesystem snapshots for container images. This is\nanalogous to the graphdriver in Docker today. Layers are unpacked into\nsnapshots.\nEvents: Supports the collection and consumption of events for providing\nconsistent, event driven behavior and auditing. Events may be replayed to\nvarious modules\nMetrics: Each components will export several metrics, accessible via\nthe metrics API. (We may want to promote this to a subsystem.\n\nClient-side components\nSome components are implemented on the client side for flexibility:\n\nDistribution: Functions for pulling and pushing images\n\nData Flow\nAs discussed above, the concept of a bundle is central to containerd. Below\nis a diagram illustrating the data flow for bundle creation.\n\nLet's take pulling an image as a demonstrated example:\n\nInstruct the Distribution layer to pull a particular image. The distribution\nlayer places the image content into the content store. The image name and\nroot manifest pointers are registered with the metadata store.\nOnce the image is pulled, the user can instruct the bundle controller to\nunpack the image into a bundle. Consuming from the content store, layers\nfrom the image are unpacked into the snapshot component.\nWhen the snapshot for the rootfs of a container is ready, the bundle\ncontroller can use the image manifest and config to prepare the execution\nconfiguration. Part of this is entering mounts into the execution config\nfrom the snapshot module.\nThe prepared bundle is then passed off to the runtime subsystem for\nexecution. It reads the bundle configuration to create a running container.\n\n"},"historical/design/data-flow.html":{"url":"historical/design/data-flow.html","title":"Data Flow","keywords":"","body":"Data Flow\nIn the past, container systems have hidden the complexity of pulling container\nimages, hiding many details and complexity. This document intends to shed light\non that complexity and detail how a \"pull\" operation will look from the\nperspective of a containerd user. We use the bundle as the target object in\nthis workflow, and walk back from there to describe the full process. In this\ncontext, we describe both pulling an image and creating a bundle from that\nimage.\nWith containerd, we redefine the \"pull\" to comprise the same set of steps\nencompassed in prior container engines. In this model, an image defines a\ncollection of resources that can be used to create a bundle. There is no\nspecific format or object called an image. The goal of the pull is to produce a\nset of steps is to resolve the resources that comprise an image, with the\nseparation providing lifecycle points in the process.\nA reference implementation of the complete \"pull\", performed client-side, will\nbe provided as part of containerd, but there may not be a single \"pull\" API\ncall.\nA rough diagram of the dataflow, along with the relevant components, is below.\n\nWhile the process proceeds left to right in the diagram, this document is\nwritten right to left. By working through this process backwards, we can best\nunderstand the approach employed by containerd.\nRunning a Container\nFor containerd, we'd generally like to retrieve a bundle. This is the\nruntime, on-disk container layout, which includes the filesystem and\nconfiguration required to run the container.\nGenerically, speaking, we can say we have the following directory:\nconfig.json\nrootfs/\nThe contents of config.json isn't interesting in this context, but for\nclarity, it may be the runc config or a containerd specific configuration file\nfor setting up a running container. The rootfs is a directory where\ncontainerd will setup the runtime container's filesystem.\nWhile containerd doesn't have the concept of an image, we can effectively build\nthis structure from an image, as projected into containerd. Given this, we can\nsay that requirements for running a container are to do the following:\n\nConvert the configuration from the container image into the target format\nfor the containerd runtime.\nReproduce the root filesystem from the container image. While we could\nunpack this into rootfs in the bundle, we can also just pass this as a set\nof mounts to the container configuration.\n\nThe above defines the framework in which we will operate. Put differently, we\ncan say that we want to create a bundle by creating these two components of a\nbundle.\nCreating a Bundle\nNow that we've defined what is required to run a container, a bundle, we need\nto create one.\nLet's say we have the following:\nctr run ubuntu\nThis does no pulling of images. It only takes the name and creates a bundle.\nBroken down into steps, the process looks as follows:\n\nLookup the digest of the image in metadata store.\nResolve the manifest in the content store.\nResolve the layer snapshots in the snapshot subsystem.\nTransform the config into the target bundle format.\nCreate a runtime snapshot for the rootfs of the container, including resolution of mounts.\nRun the container.\n\nFrom this, we can understand the required resources to pull an image:\n\nAn entry in the metadata store a name pointing at a particular digest.\nThe manifest must be available in the content store.\nThe result of successively applied layers must be available as a snapshot.\n\nUnpacking Layers\nWhile this process may be pull or run driven, the idea is quite simple. For\neach layer, apply the result to a snapshot of the previous layer. The result\nshould be stored under the chain id (as defined by OCI) of the resulting\napplication.\nPulling an Image\nWith all the above defined, pulling an image simply becomes the following:\n\nFetch the manifest for the image, verify and store it.\nFetch each layer of the image manifest, verify and store them.\nStore the manifest digest under the provided name.\n\nNote that we leave off using the name to resolve a particular location. We'll\nleave that for another doc!\n"},"historical/design/lifecycle.html":{"url":"historical/design/lifecycle.html","title":"Lifecycle","keywords":"","body":"Container Lifecycle\nWhile containerd is a daemon that provides API to manage multiple containers, the containers themselves are not tied to the lifecycle of containerd.  Each container has a shim that acts as the direct parent for the container's processes as well as reporting the exit status and holding onto the STDIO of the container.  This also allows containerd to crash and restore all functionality to containers.\ncontainerd\nThe daemon provides an API to manage multiple containers.  It can handle locking in process where needed to coordinate tasks between subsystems.  While the daemon does fork off the needed processes to run containers, the shim and runc, these are re-parented to the system's init.\nshim\nEach container has its own shim that acts as the direct parent of the container's processes.  The shim is responsible for keeping the IO and/or pty master of the container open, writing the container's exit status for containerd, and reaping the container's processes when they exit.  Since the shim owns the container's pty master, it provides an API for resizing.\nOverall, a container's lifecycle is not tied to the containerd daemon.  The daemon is a management API for multiple container whose lifecycle is tied to one shim per container.\n"},"historical/design/mounts.html":{"url":"historical/design/mounts.html","title":"Mounts","keywords":"","body":"Mounts\nMounts are the main interaction mechanism in containerd.

This ensures that the mounts are performed as a\nunit and unmounted as a unit.\nFrom an architecture perspective, components produce mounts and runtime\nexecutors consume them.\nMore imaginative use cases include the ability to virtualize a series of mounts\nfrom various components without ever having to create a runtime.

Layers provide the ability to fork a\nfilesystem, make changes then save the changeset back to a new layer.\nHistorically, these have been tightly integrated into the Docker daemon as a\ncomponent called the graphdriver. The graphdriver allows one to run the\ndocker daemon on several different operating systems while still maintaining\nroughly similar snapshot semantics for committing and distributing changes to\nimages.\nThe graphdriver is deeply integrated with the import and export of images,\nincluding managing layer relationships and container runtime filesystems. The\nbehavior of the graphdriver informs the transport of image formats.\nIn this document, we propose a more flexible model for managing layers. It\nfocuses on providing an API for the base snapshotting functionality without\ncoupling so tightly to the structure of images and their identification. The\nminimal API simplifies behavior without sacrificing power. This makes the\nsurface area for driver implementations smaller, ensuring that behavior is more\nconsistent between implementations.\nThese differ from the concept of the graphdriver in that the Snapshotter\nhas no knowledge of images or containers. Users simply prepare and commit\ndirectories. We also avoid the integration between graph drivers and the tar\nformat used to represent the changesets.\nThe best aspect is that we can get to this model by refactoring the existing\ngraphdrivers, minimizing the need for new code and sprawling tests.\nScope\nIn the past, the graphdriver component has provided quite a lot of\nfunctionality in Docker. This includes serialization, hashing, unpacking,\npacking, mounting.\nThe Snapshotter will only provide mount-oriented snapshot\naccess with minimal metadata. Serialization, hashing, unpacking, packing and\nmounting are not included in this design, opting for common implementations\nbetween graphdrivers, rather than specialized ones. This is less of a problem\nfor performance since direct access to changesets is provided in the\ninterface.\nArchitecture\nThe Snapshotter provides an API for allocating, snapshotting and mounting\nabstract, layer-based filesystems. The model works by building up sets of\ndirectories with parent-child relationships, known as Snapshots.\nA Snapshot represents a filesystem state.  Every snapshot has a parent,\nwhere the empty parent is represented by the empty string.  A diff can be taken\nbetween a parent and its snapshot to create a classic layer.\nSnapshots are best understood by their lifecycle.  Active snapshots are always\ncreated with Prepare or View from a Committed snapshot (including the\nempty snapshot).  Committed snapshots are always created with\nCommit from an Active snapshot.  Active snapshots never become committed\nsnapshots and vice versa. All snapshots may be removed.\nAfter mounting an Active snapshot, changes can be made to the snapshot.  The\nact of committing creates a Committed snapshot.  The committed snapshot will\ninherit the parent of the active snapshot.  The committed snapshot can then be\nused as a parent.  Active snapshots can never be used as a parent.\nThe following diagram demonstrates the relationships of snapshots:\n\nIn this diagram, you can see that the active snapshot a is created by calling\nPrepare with the committed snapshot P0.  After modification, a\nbecomes a' and a committed snapshot P1 is created by calling\nCommit.  a' can be further modified as a'' and a second committed snapshot\ncan be created as P2 by calling Commit again.  Note here that\nP2's parent is P0 and not P1.\nOperations\nThe manifestation of snapshots is facilitated by the Mount object and\nuser-defined directories used for opaque data storage. When creating a new\nactive snapshot, the caller provides an identifier called the key. This\noperation returns a list of mounts that, if mounted, will have the fully\nprepared snapshot at the mounted path. We call this the prepare operation.\nOnce a snapshot is prepared and mounted, the caller may write new data to the\nsnapshot. Depending on the application, a user may want to capture these changes\nor not.\nFor a read-only view of a snapshot, the view operation can be used. Like\nprepare, view will return a list of mounts that, if mounted, will have the\nfully prepared snapshot at the mounted path.\nIf the user wants to keep the changes, the commit operation is employed. The\ncommit operation takes the key identifier, which represents an active\nsnapshot, and a name identifier. A successful result will create a committed\nsnapshot that can be used as the parent of new active snapshots when\nreferenced by the name.\nIf the user wants to discard the changes in an active snapshot, the remove\noperation will release any resources associated with the snapshot.  The mounts\nprovided by prepare or view should be unmounted before calling this method.\nIf the user wants to discard committed snapshots, the remove operation can\nalso be used, but any children must be removed before proceeding.\nFor detailed usage information, see the\nGoDoc.\nGraph metadata\nAs snapshots are imported into the container system, a \"graph\" of snapshots and\ntheir parents will form. Queries over this graph must be a supported operation.\nHow snapshots work\nTo flesh out the Snapshots terminology, we are going to demonstrate the use of\nthe Snapshotter from the perspective of importing layers. We'll use a Go API\nto represent the process.\nImporting a Layer\nTo import a layer, we simply have the Snapshotter provide a list of\nmounts to be applied such that our destination will capture a changeset. We start\nout by getting a path to the layer tar file and creating a temp location to\nunpack it to:\nlayerPath, tmpDir := getLayerPath(), mkTmpDir() // just a path to layer tar file.\nWe start by using a Snapshotter to Prepare a new snapshot transaction, using\na key and descending from the empty parent \"\":\nmounts, err := snapshotter.Prepare(key, \"\")\nif err != nil { ... }\nWe get back a list of mounts from Snapshotter.Prepare, with the key\nidentifying the active snapshot. Mount this to the temporary location with the\nfollowing:\nif err := mount.All(mounts, tmpDir); err != nil { ... }\nOnce the mounts are performed, our temporary location is ready to capture\na diff. In practice, this works similar to a filesystem transaction. The\nnext step is to unpack the layer. We have a special function unpackLayer\nthat applies the contents of the layer to target location and calculates the\nDiffID of the unpacked layer (this is a requirement for docker\nimplementation):\nlayer, err := os.Open(layerPath)\nif err != nil { ... }\ndigest, err := unpackLayer(tmpLocation, layer) // unpack into layer location\nif err != nil { ... }\nWhen the above completes, we should have a filesystem the represents the\ncontents of the layer. Careful implementations should verify that digest\nmatches the expected DiffID. When completed, we unmount the mounts:\nunmount(mounts) // optional, for now\nNow that we've verified and unpacked our layer, we commit the active\nsnapshot to a name. For this example, we are just going to use the layer\ndigest, but in practice, this will probably be the ChainID:\nif err := snapshotter.Commit(digest.String(), key); err != nil { ... }\nNow, we have a layer in the Snapshotter that can be accessed with the digest\nprovided during commit. Once you have committed the snapshot, the active\nsnapshot can be removed with the following:\nsnapshotter.Remove(key)\nImporting the Next Layer\nMaking a layer depend on the above is identical to the process described\nabove except that the parent is provided as parent when calling\nSnapshotter.Prepare, assuming a clean tmpLocation:\nmounts, err := snapshotter.Prepare(tmpLocation, parentDigest)\nWe then mount, apply and commit, as we did above. The new snapshot will be\nbased on the content of the previous one.\nRunning a Container\nTo run a container, we simply provide Snapshotter.Prepare the committed image\nsnapshot as the parent. After mounting, the prepared path can\nbe used directly as the container's filesystem:\nmounts, err := snapshotter.Prepare(containerKey, imageRootFSChainID)\nThe returned mounts can then be passed directly to the container runtime. If\none would like to create a new image from the filesystem, Snapshotter.Commit\nis called:\nif err := snapshotter.Commit(newImageSnapshot, containerKey); err != nil { ... }\nAlternatively, for most container runs, Snapshotter.Remove will be called to\nsignal the Snapshotter to abandon the changes.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-01-13.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-01-13.html","title":"2017 01 13","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for Jan 13, 2017\nPreface\nI wanted to try something different for this project during its development by giving a weekly summary on the progress and what is being working on.  I figured the best place is to keep the reports in the repo.  Please give your feedback on the format and let me know if this is a waste of time or if there is something better we can do.\nQuick Start and Vendoring\nThis week we merged PRs adding a quick start guide with build instructions to help get new contributors onboard quicker.  We also merged a vendoring PR so everyone has the same revision of packages for the project.  It can add a little burden on development having vendoring at this early stage, especially the way we have to do vendoring in Go, but it ensures that everyone contributing has a consistent environment.\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/400\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/390\n\nMilestones\nI spent some time yesterday working on milestones.  The milestones are more goal focused instead of being based on a versions or a date.  We have goals that we want to hit in each of the phases and the milestones are organized that way.\nWe are currently in the bootstrap phase.  Much of the design work, getting the project's infrastructure up (ci, vendoring, guides for development, etc) are part of this work.\nThe milestones will give you the most up-to-date view on the project and what is being worked on when.\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/milestones\n\nNetworking\nContainerd will not support networking in its core.  Based on the feedback we received and our own experience with networking we can confidently leave this out of containerd without impacting functionality.  You can see the full discussion in the issue linked below.\nNetworking means many different things today and is becoming more software based.  On the runtime level, overlay networking is very simple, its just veth interfaces.  All of the overlay magic happens at the upper levels with routing tables and termination outside of the runtime and interfaces.  Networking also contains various forms of service discovery which should not be at the runtime level as things like health checks come into play to make sure you are only discovering healthy services.\nI personally feel like this is a good move for the project.  We have good primitives at the runtime level with the create/start split that allows a container's network namespace to be created and time for a network plugin to create and add interfaces to the container before the user's process is started.  We also have the ability for containers to join pre-existing network namespaces that have already been populated by a networking implementation.\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/362\n\nRuntime and Shim\nWe finished porting over the shim from the existing containerd implementation that is being used today.  This makes sure that the containers are not tied to the daemon's lifecycle.  This allows containerd to reattach to the STDIO and receive exit events for the containers when it is no longer the parent of these processes.\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/417\n\nWhat's Next?\nNext week we will be working towards a full PoC with the runtime, storage, and fetching of images.  Getting the core functionality up and running quickly is important to us to ensure that integration between the different subsystems in the core flow well together.  We want to make sure the responsibilities of pulling an image from a remote source do not spill into the storage layer and vice-versa.\nWe still have more documentation work to do on the design and lifecycle of components in the core which is another focus for next week.  You can find the current design docs in the repo here.\nI hope this status report helps.  If you are looking for ways to contribute, check out the issues on the current milestone.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-01-20.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-01-20.html","title":"2017 01 20","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for Jan 20, 2017\nThis week we worked on refactoring the storage and runtime aspects of containerd, much of this work won't be completed until next week.\nDistribution tool\n@stevvooe started work on a dist tool for fetching images and other distribution aspects.  One of the problems we wanted to solve with containerd is the ability to decouple the fetch of image contents, the unpacking of the contents, and the storage of the contents.  Separating these lets us download content as non-root on machines and only elevate privileges when the contents need to be unpacked on disk.\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/452\n\nShim Work\nA large part of my week I have been working on the shim.  It is a very core aspect of containerd and allows containers to run without being tied to the lifecycle of the containerd daemon.  With this work we will end up with one shim per container that manages all additional processes in the container.  This saves resources on the system as well as makes interacting with the shim much easier.  We are placing the shim behind a GRPC API instead of the pipe based protocol that we have today.\nI don't have a PR open at this time but expect something next week.\nGeneral Improvements\nWe worked on the build process this week as well as improvements across the codebase.

These parts are critical in forming an end to end proof\nof concept, taking docker/oci images and turning them into bundles.\nWe also have defined a new GRPC protocol for interacting with the\ncontainer-shim, which is used for robust container management.\nMaintainers\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/473\n\nDerek McGowan will be joining the containerd team as a maintainer.

This allows us\nto have a more robust way to interface with the shim.  It also allows us to\nhave one shim per container where previously we had one shim per process.  This\ndrastically reduces the memory usage for exec processes.\nWe also had a lot of code in the containerd core for syncing with the shims\nduring execution.  This was because we needed ways to signal if the shim was\nrunning, the container was created or any errors on create and then starting\nthe container's process.  Getting this right and syncing was hard and required\na lot of code.  With the new flow it is just function calls via rpc.\nservice Shim {\n    rpc Create(CreateRequest) returns (CreateResponse);\n    rpc Start(StartRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);\n    rpc Delete(DeleteRequest) returns (DeleteResponse);\n    rpc Exec(ExecRequest) returns (ExecResponse);\n    rpc Pty(PtyRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);\n    rpc Events(EventsRequest) returns (stream Event);\n    rpc State(StateRequest) returns (StateResponse);\n}\n\nWith the GRPC service it allows us to decouple the shim's lifecycle from the\ncontainers, in the way that we get synchronous feedback if the container failed\nto create, start, or exec from shim errors.\nThe overhead for adding GRPC to the shim is actually less than the initial\nimplementation.  We already had a few pipes that allowed you to control\nresizing of the pty master and exit events, now all replaced by one unix\nsocket.  Unix sockets are cheap and fast and we reduce our open fd count with\nway by not relying on multiple fifos.  \nWe also added a subcommand to the ctr command for testing and interfacing\nwith the shim.  You can interact with a shim directly via ctr shim and get\nevents, start containers, start exec processes.\nDistribution Tool\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/452\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/472\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/474\n\nLast week, @stevvooe committed the first parts of the distribution tool. The main\ncomponent provided there was the dist fetch command. This has been followed\nup by several other low-level commands that interact with content resolution\nand local storage that can be used together to work with parts of images.\nWith this change, we add the following commands to the dist tool:\n\ningest: verify and accept content into storage\nactive: display active ingest processes\nlist: list content in storage\npath: provide a path to a blob by digest\ndelete: remove a piece of content from storage\napply: apply a layer to a directory\n\nWhen this is more solidified, we can roll these up into higher-level\noperations that can be orchestrated through the dist tool or via GRPC.\nAs part of the Development Report, we thought it was a good idea to show\nthese tools in depth. Specifically, we can show going from an image locator to\na root filesystem with the current suite of commands.\nFetching Image Resources\nThe first component added to the dist tool is the fetch command. It is a\nlow-level command for fetching image resources, such as manifests and layers.\nIt operates around the concept of remotes. Objects are fetched by providing a\nlocator and an object identifier. The locator, roughly analogous to an\nimage name or repository, is a schema-less URL. The following is an example of\na locator:\ndocker.io/library/redis\nWhen we say the locator is a \"schema-less URL\", we mean that it starts with\nhostname and has a path, representing some image repository. While the hostname\nmay represent an actual location, we can pass it through arbitrary resolution\nsystems to get the actual location. In that sense, it acts like a namespace.\nIn practice, the locator can be used to resolve a remote. Object\nidentifiers are then passed to this remote, along with hints, which are then\nmapped to the specific protocol and retrieved.  By dispatching on this common\nidentifier, we should be able to support almost any protocol and discovery\nmechanism imaginable.\nThe actual fetch command currently provides anonymous access to Docker Hub\nimages, keyed by the locator namespace docker.io. With a locator,\nidentifier and hint, the correct protocol and endpoints are resolved and the\nresource is printed to stdout. As an example, one can fetch the manifest for\nredis with the following command:\n$ ./dist fetch docker.io/library/redis latest mediatype:application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\nNote that we have provided a mediatype \"hint\", nudging the fetch implementation\nto grab the correct endpoint. We can hash the output of that to fetch the same\ncontent by digest:\n$ ./dist fetch docker.io/library/redis sha256:$(./dist fetch docker.io/library/redis latest mediatype:application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json | shasum -a256)\nThe hint now elided on the outer command, since we have affixed the content to\na particular hash. The above shows us effectively fetches by tag, then by hash\nto demonstrate the equivalence when interacting with a remote.\nThis is just the beginning. We should be able to centralize configuration\naround fetch to implement a number of distribution methodologies that have been\nchallenging or impossible up to this point.\nKeep reading to see how this is used with the other commands to fetch complete\nimages.\nFetching all the layers of an image\nIf you are not yet entertained, let's bring jq and xargs into the mix for\nmaximum fun. Our first task will be to collect the layers into a local content\nstore with the ingest command.\nThe following incantation fetches the manifest and downloads each layer:\n$ ./dist fetch docker.io/library/redis latest mediatype:application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json | \\\n    jq -r '.layers[] | \"./dist fetch docker.io/library/redis \"+.digest + \"| ./dist ingest --expected-digest \"+.digest+\" --expected-size \"+(.size | tostring) +\" docker.io/library/redis@\"+.digest' | xargs -I{} -P10 -n1 sh -c \"{}\"\nThe above fetches a manifest, pipes it to jq, which assembles a shell pipeline\nto ingest each layer into the content store. Because the transactions are keyed\nby their digest, concurrent downloads and downloads of repeated content are\nignored. Each process is then executed parallel using xargs.  If you run the\nabove command twice, it will not download the layers because those blobs are\nalready present in the content store.\nWhat about status? Let's first remove our content so we can monitor a download.\ndist list can be combined with xargs and dist delete to remove that\ncontent:\n$ ./dist list -q | xargs ./dist delete\nIn a separate shell session, could monitor the active downloads with the following:\n$ watch -n0.2 ./dist active\nFor now, the content is downloaded into .content in the current working\ndirectory. To watch the contents of this directory, you can use the following:\n$ watch -n0.2 tree .content\nNow, run the fetch pipeline from above. You'll see the active downloads, keyed\nby locator and object, as well as the ingest transactions resulting blobs\nbecoming available in the content store. This will help to understand what is\ngoing on internally.\nGetting to a rootfs\nWhile we haven't yet integrated full snapshot support for layer application, we\ncan use the dist apply command to start building out rootfs for inspection\nand testing. We'll build up a similar pipeline to unpack the layers and get an\nactual image rootfs.\nTo get access to the layers, you can use the path command: \n$./dist path sha256:010c454d55e53059beaba4044116ea4636f8dd8181e975d893931c7e7204fffa\nsha256:010c454d55e53059beaba4044116ea4636f8dd8181e975d893931c7e7204fffa /home/sjd/go/src/github.com/containerd/containerd/.content/blobs/sha256/010c454d55e53059beaba4044116ea4636f8dd8181e975d893931c7e7204fffa\nThis returns the a direct path to the blob to facilitate fast access. We can\nincorporate this into the apply command to get to a rootfs for redis:\n$ mkdir redis-rootfs\n$ ./dist fetch docker.io/library/redis latest mediatype:application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json | \\\n    jq -r '.layers[] | \"sudo ./dist apply ./redis-rootfs The above fetches the manifest, then passes each layer into the dist apply\ncommand, resulting in the full redis container root filesystem. We do not do\nthis in parallel, since each layer must be applied sequentially. Also, note\nthat we have to run apply with sudo, since the layers typically have\nresources with root ownership.\nAlternatively, you can just read the manifest from the content store, rather\nthan fetching it. We use fetch above to avoid having to lookup the manifest\ndigest for our demo.\nNote that this is mostly a POC. This tool has a long way to go. Things like\nfailed downloads and abandoned download cleanup aren't quite handled. We'll\nprobably make adjustments around how content store transactions are handled to\naddress this. We still need to incorporate snapshotting, as well as the ability\nto calculate the ChainID under subsequent unpacking. Once we have some tools\nto play around with snapshotting, we'll be able to incorporate our\nrootfs.ApplyLayer algorithm that will get us a lot closer to a production\nworthy system.\nFrom here, we'll build out full image pull and create tooling to get runtime\nbundles from the fetched content.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-02-10.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-02-10.html","title":"2017 02 10","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for Feb 10, 2017\nSorry for slacking off last week on the report.  We totally spaced it.\nThis week we will go over what happened last week and this week.\nSnapshot Design Changes\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/496\n\nAfter receiving feedback on the snapshot.Driver interface, now known as the\nSnapshotter, it was found that the behavior of active and committed snapshots\nwas confusing.  Specifically, it was hard to tell which methods to use based on\nthe state of the snapshot. It was also confusing which identifier to use based\non the state.\nTo clean this up, we moved to using \"Active\" and \"Committed\" as the type of a\nsnapshot, as opposed to the state of the snapshot. These lifecycle\nrelationships are such that \"Active\" snapshots can only be created from a\n\"Committed\" snapshot and \"Committed\" snapshots must come from an \"Active\"\nsnapshot. We retain the concept of a parent for \"Active\" and \"Committed\"\nsnapshots, but clarified that only \"Committed\" snapshots can be a parent.\nAs part of this, we unified the keyspace of snapshots. For common operations,\nsuch as removal and stat, we only have a single method that works for both\nactive and committed snapshots. For methods that take one or the other, the\nrestriction is called out. Remove and Delete were consolidated as part of\nthis. This also makes it easier to handle scenarios that use the snapshot\nidentity as a lock to coordinate multiple writers.\nExists and Parent have also be consolidated into single Stat call. This\nreturns an Info structure which includes information about state and\nparentage. We also simplify the Walk method as part of this.\nEffectively, we now have snapshots that are either active or committed and a\nmuch smaller interface!\nBundles Bundles Bundles\nWe spend time talking with people implementing Windows support as well as a few other users.\nOne the major issues with our current approach was that bundles were a central part of our architecture.\nThe content and storage subsystems would produce bundles and the execution subsystem would consume them.\nHowever, with a bundle being on the filesystem, having this concept does not work as smoothly on Windows\nas it would for Unix platforms.\nSo the major design change is that bundles will be an implementation detail of the runtime and not a core\npart of the API.  You will no longer pass the bundle path to containerd, it will manage bundles internally\nand the root filesystem mounts along with the spec, passed via the Any type, will be API fields for the \ncreate request of a container.\nRuntimes\nWith the bundles change above we also need to make sure changes for where containers are created and who\ndoes the supervision after creation.\nThe runtimes in containerd, things such as Linux, Windows, and Solaris, will be responsible for the \ncreation of containers and loading of containers when containerd boots.\nThe containerd core will be responsible for interfacing with the GRPC API and managing a common Container \ninterface that the runtimes produce.  The supervision of containers will be handled in the core. \nThis is not much of a change from today, just refining where responsibilities lie. \nProgress and POC\nOverall design has been a large focus for us at the moment.  While containerd can run containers today it \nis not optimized in terms of speed or design.  With the work we did this week to make sure that containerd \nwill work across many different platforms with first class support, not as an after thought, we are in a good \nposition to really start on the development work and get a POC out within the next few weeks.  \nThis POC should give you a good idea of what containerd can do, its APIs, and how users will interact with\nits various subsystems.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-02-24.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-02-24.html","title":"2017 02 24","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for Feb 24, 2017\ncontainerd Summit\nYesterday, Feb. 23, we had the containerd summit for contributors and maintainers.  We started off by getting everyone up to speed on the project, roadmap, and goals before diving down into specific issues and design of containerd.  We should have the videos up soon for the various sessions and Q&A.\nRuntime Breakout Session\nShim\nWe discussed the use of the containerd shim, the costs that it adds, as well as its benefits.  Overall, most of us agreed that the extra memory overhead is worth it for the feature set that it provides.\nHowever, we did make a few changes to the shim in the master branch; a grpc API so that the shim is straightforward to interact with and much more robust in terms of error handling.  We also have one shim per container vs the one shim per process, which was the current implementation.\nThere were a couple of additional changes we discussed.  One being launching the shim inside the cgroup of the container so that any IO, CPU, and memory that the shim consumes is \"charged\" to the container.  I'll expand a little more on why this matters in the next section when it comes to logging.\nLogging\nLogging is a big issue for containers and it’s not exactly straightforward.  Since containers can be used in many different ways the support of logging and connecting to a containers interactively can add complexity to the runtime.  Right now, the shim is responsible for handling the IO of a container and making sure that it is kept open in the event that containerd ( the daemon ) or clients above containerd crash and need to reconnect to containers that they launched.\nYou can use fifos for reconnecting to container logs but there is concerns about the buffer limit when nothing is reading from the fifo.  If the fifo fills up, then the application in the container will block.  In the end, most container systems log to files on disk but in various formats.  The only part of the container's IO that needs to be a pipe, or fifo for reconnection is STDIN.  STDOUT and STDERR can go directly to a file in most cases.  However, logging the raw output for a container directly to a file is not ideal as both Docker and Kube have specific on disk formats.  \nSo our initial idea that was discussed is to move some type of \"log formatter\" into the shim.  This will allow a single container to have its logs written directly to disk from the shim without using fifos for OUT and ERR.  The other problem that this would solve is when a single container has excessive logs.  If a single daemon is writing all the logs to disk, you will see high CPU on the entire daemon.  If we place the shim in the cgroup for the container, then only that container is affected when it starts to log excessively without affecting the performance of the entire system.  The CPU and IO could be charged to the container.\nWe still have to work out how we will specify the log format in the shim.  Go 1.8 plugins are not looking like a good solution for this.  I’ll be opening an issue so that we can figure this out on the repo.\nMultitenancy Metadata\nA use case for containerd is that it’s a solid base for multiple container platforms.  When you have a single containerd installed on a system but have Kube, Docker, and Swarm all using it, different operations such as listing of containers and access to content need to be scoped appropriately so that Docker does not return containers created by Kube and vice versa.  \nWe were already looking to design a metadata store for clients and internal data of containerd and this seems like a good fit for this problem.  In the breakout session we discussed having system details like content and containers stay in a flat namespace inside the containerd core but query and create operations by clients should be namespaced.\nAs simple example would be:\n/docker/images/redis/3.2\n/docker/containers/redis-master\n/kube/services/lb\n/kube/pods/redis/containers/logger\n/kube/pods/redis/containers/master\nThese are just simple examples and much of the format will be left up to the clients for storing metadata within the system.  Clients should be able to query based on the namespace of keys as well as queries of / to see the entire system as a whole.\nPlugins in Go 1.8\nLooking at the latest Go 1.8 release plugins looked like a perfect solution for extending containerd by third parties.  However, after discussions at the summit and with help from Tim to get clarification on the feature from the Go team it does not not look very promising in terms of implementation.  We currently have the code for plugins via go 1.8 merged into master but we will have to rethink our extension method going forward.\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/563\nStorage and Distribution Breakout Session\nSnapshots\nDuring the image distribution breakout we first covered the current state of snapshots and where we expect to go next. The discussion started with how new snapshotters will be integrated using Go plugins or package importing rather than relying on grpc. Snapshots themselves are not currently exposed as a grpc service but there is some desire to have lower level access for debugging, content sideloading, or building. The exposed interface for snapshots beyond the existing pull/push/run workflows will be designed with this in mind. Additionally there was some discussion related to the possibility of having the mounter be pluggable and opening up snapshots to volumes use cases. The snapshot model was discussed in depth including how we will differentiate between terminal commits and online snapshots. Differentiating between the two could be important to optimize different use cases around building, importing, and backing up container changes.\nDistribution\nThe next major topic of discussion was around distribution, primarily focused on the resolver and fetcher interfaces. We discussed what a locator will look for finding remote content as well as how they can be integrated with a git remote-like model. Stephen expressed his intent to keep the locator as opaque as possible, but to stay away from including protocol definitions in the locator value. Having a remotes table was proposed was proposed as a way to keep naming simple but allow defining more specific protocols. The current fetch interface was found to be unclear. It was proposed to remove the hints and integrate the media type checks and expectations into the resolver. Role of content store discussed for validating content and converging ingests of duplicate data.\nUpcoming work\n\nNext week we are still working towards and end to end PoC with the various subsystems of containerd working together behind the GRPC api.  The API is still under development but the PoC should give people a good idea how the various subsystems will interact with one another.\nWe will also try to get issues up on the repository from discussions at the summit so we can continue the discussions during the summit with the broader community.\nRethinking an extension model.  Extending containerd is important for many people.  It makes sure that third parties do not have to commit code to the core to gain the functionality that they require.  However, it’s not simple in Go and Go 1.8 plugins do not look like the solution.  We need to work more on this. \n\n"},"historical/reports/2017-03-10.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-03-10.html","title":"2017 03 10","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for Mar 10, 2017\nRuntime\nThis week I (@crosbymichael) have been working on the OCI runtime specifications.  Since containerd is to be fully compliant with the OCI specs we need to make sure we reach a 1.0 and have a solid base to build on.  We are getting very close on the spec side and have a final rc out for review.  If you have time please check it out. \nI have also been working on the runc side of things, fixing terminal handling for exec and implementing the changes in our go bindings.\nReaper\nI have also worked on adding a global process monitor/reaper to containerd.  The issues before with having a SIGCHLD reaper is that the Go exec.Cmd and especially its Wait method did not play well together.  This would cause races between the reaper doing a waitpid and the exec.Cmd doing a Wait.  I think we solved this problem fully now as long as code is written against the reaper api.  It is a little more of a burden on developers of containerd but makes it much more robust when dealing with processes being reparented to containerd and its shim.\nSnapshot Dynamic Registration\nWe merged a PR making the snapshot registration dynamic.  This allows users to compile containerd with additional shapshotters than the ones we have builtin to the core.  Because of the current state of Go 1.8 plugins the best course of action for adding additional runtimes, snapshotters, and other extensions is to modify the builtins.go file for the containerd command and recompile.  Hopefully the short comings will be fixed in later Go releases.\npackage main\n\n// register containerd builtins here\nimport (\n    _ \"github.com/containerd/containerd/linux\"\n    _ \"github.com/containerd/containerd/services/content\"\n    _ \"github.com/containerd/containerd/services/execution\"\n    _ \"github.com/containerd/containerd/snapshot/btrfs\"\n    _ \"github.com/containerd/containerd/snapshot/overlay\"\n)\n\nUpdate on Dates\nWe are working towards being feature complete mid April, with a Q2 1.0.  The Beta milestone on github should reflect this goal and the dates associated with it.\nAfter we hit a feature complete state we hope to finish the Docker, swarm, and kube CRI integrations to make sure that we provide the feature set that is required for each, before locking down the APIs.\nContainerd Summit\nThere is going to be another containerd summit at Dockecon this year.  I created a document in the repository so that everyone can add discussion points for the breakout sessions.  We should have a much larger crowd than the previous summit, therefore, having a few pre-defined discussion points will help.  We will still have ad-hoc discussions but it never hurts to be prepared.\nNext\nWe are still moving forward so that we can have the distribution, content, and snapshotters all working together over the API.  One of the challenges is to make sure things work well over GRPC.  We need to be able to support things like docker build and making sure that it performs as good or better than what you expect.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-03-17.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-03-17.html","title":"2017 03 17","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for Mar 17, 2017\nTesting Plan\nThanks to @gianarb for starting the discussion around a test and CI plan for containerd.

label will be the id of the container so users can filter on the metrics for only the containers that they care about.\nThe frequency of metric collection is configurable via the prometheus scrape time.  Every time the /metrics API is hit, that is when container metrics are collected.  There is no internal timer in containerd, you only pay the cost of collecting metrics when you are asking for them.  If you never ask for metrics the collection never happens.\nThere should be a PR up soon so that we can discuss the metrics and label names.\nImage Pull\n\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/640\n\nWe now have a proof of concept of end to end pull.  Up to this point, the\nrelationship between subsystems has been somewhat theoretical. We now leverage\nfetching, the snapshot drivers, the rootfs service, image metadata and the\nexecution service, validating the proposed model for containerd.  There are a\nfew caveats, including the need to move some of the access into GRPC services,\nbut the basic components are there.\nThe first command we will cover here is dist pull. This is the analog of\ndocker pull and git pull. It performs a full resource fetch for an image\nand unpacks the root filesystem into the snapshot drivers. An example follows:\n$ sudo ./bin/dist pull docker.io/library/redis:latest\ndocker.io/library/redis:latest:                                                   resolved       |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nmanifest-sha256:4c8fb09e8d634ab823b1c125e64f0e1ceaf216025aa38283ea1b42997f1e8059: done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:3b281f2bcae3b25c701d53a219924fffe79bdb74385340b73a539ed4020999c4:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nconfig-sha256:e4a35914679d05d25e2fccfd310fde1aa59ffbbf1b0b9d36f7b03db5ca0311b0:   done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:4b7726832aec75f0a742266c7190c4d2217492722dfd603406208eaa902648d8:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:338a7133395941c85087522582af182d2f6477dbf54ba769cb24ec4fd91d728f:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:83f12ff60ff1132d1e59845e26c41968406b4176c1a85a50506c954696b21570:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:693502eb7dfbc6b94964ae66ebc72d3e32facd981c72995b09794f1e87bac184:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:622732cddc347afc9360b4b04b46c6f758191a1dc73d007f95548658847ee67e:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:19a7e34366a6f558336c364693df538c38307484b729a36fede76432789f084f:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nelapsed: 1.6 s                                                                    total:   0.0 B (0.0 B/s)\nINFO[0001] unpacking rootfs\n\nNote that we haven't integrated rootfs unpacking into the status output, but we\npretty much have what is in docker today (:P).

Last week was Dockercon and many people inside Docker and external contributors where in Austin for the week.  It was a long week and we didn't get much work done on the project but it was good meeting everyone IRL and putting a face to the github handle.  Also, thank you to everyone that stayed a day late to attend the summit on Thursday.  You can see the summit notes at the bottom of this report.\nNew Projects to the Org.\nWe are looking to move some of our dependencies used by containerd into the org.  We want to have a simple maintainer model for containerd and any other repository that is added to the org.  Basically, if you are a maintainer of containerd, you are a maintainer on all of the repos.  We don't want to have separate maintainers for the various parts as we should all share the responsibility for quality and stability for the project as a whole.\nWe have an issue on github discussing the various projects that we want to add.  If you have any feedback please let us know on the issue below.\nprojects!\nprocess\nDarwin/BSD Port\nJustin has begun work on porting over containerd to Darwin and BSD.  ctr compiles and there were a few changes in terminal handling that had to be made but overall its going fairly smooth.  You can ping @justincormack for more information or if you are interested in working on something like a BSD jails port of runc.\nIntrospection\n@AkihiroSuda has been working on introspection RPCs to make sure consumers know the services and features that they are interacting with.  There is still a lot to consider when exposing service versions, containerd versions and functionality; if you have any input you can take a look at the current PR here.\nExpanded Registry Support\n@dmcgowan has been working on expanding registry support with authentication in 783.  This expands registry support for gcr.io, Dockerhub, and local registries.\nTask List for week of May 1\nSo, now that we are all back from Dockercon and not rested at all, what's on the agenda for next week?\n\nDocker Integration Pass\nReplace the current v0.2.x branch of containerd in Docker for execution with the 1.0 execution service\n\n\nConverge Event Handling\nMove new projects into containerd organization\nNew Layer creation for supporting build\nContinue work on metadata service\ncontainer\nlayer\nimage\nnamespace support\n\n\n\nIf are you looking for areas to contribute to containerd just take a pass through the issue tracker.  There are issues such as 770 that could use some help in solving as well as other.  Also feel free to stop by the slack channel for containerd to chat and find ideas on what needs to be developed next.\ncontainerd Summit Notes\nHere are the notes from the containerd summit that was held after Dockercon.  If there are important to you and you would like to start working on a feature, fix, request, please go ahead and open an issue on github.

If yes, what metrics should be included? How to implement that?”\nPreviously discussed, yes, PR to provide this information through the snapshot interface.\nFiguring out what is being shared, could figure out it from mapping layers to images\n\n\n“Support for disk quotas: How?

One thing that we have ran into was the disconnect of what our Container model is and what users expect, docker create;docker start;docker rm vs a container that is destroyed when it exits.\nTo users, containers are more of a metadata object that resources(rw, configuration) and information(state, last exit status) are attached to.  We have been reworking what we call a \"container\" today to be called a \"task\" and a Container metadata object.  The task only has runtime state:  a pid, namespaces, cgroups, etc.  A container has an id, root filesystem, configuration, and other metadata from a user.\nManaging static state and runtime state in the same object is very tricky so we choose to keep execution and metadata separate.  We are hoping to not cause more confusion with this additional task object.  You can see a mockup of a client interacting with a container and how the task is handled below:\ncontainer, err := client.NewContainer(id, spec, rootfs)\n\ntask, err := container.CreateTask(containerd.Stdio())\ntask.Start()\ntask.Pid()\ntask.Kill(syscall.SIGKILL)\n\ncontainer.Delete()\n\ncontainer metadata PR\nCheckpoint && Restore\nThere is a PR open for checkpoint and restore within containerd.  We needed to port over this code from the existing containerd branch but we are able to do more in terms of functionality since we have filesystem and distribution built in.  The overall functionality for checkpoint/restore is that you can still checkpoint containers but instead of having a directory on disk with the checkpointed data, it is checkpointed to the content store.\nHaving checkpoints in the content store allows you to push checkpoints that include the container's memory data, rw layer with the file contents that the container has written, and other resources like bind(volumes) to a registry that is running so that you can live migrate containers to other hosts in your cluster.  And you can do all this with your existing registries; no other services required to migrate containers around your data center.\ncheckpoint restore PR\nSnapshot and Diff Service\nThe RootFS service has been removed and replaced with a snapshot service and\ndiff service. The snapshot service provides access to all snapshotter methods\nand allows clients to operate directly against the snapshotter interface. This\nenables clients to prepare RW layers as it could before with the RootFS service,\nbut also has full access to commit or remove those snapshots directly. The diff\nservice provides 2 methods, extract and diff. The extract takes in a set of\nmounts and a descriptor to a layer tar, mounts, then extracts the tar from the\ncontent store into the mount. The diff service takes in 2 sets of mounts,\ncomputes the diff, sends the diff to the content store and returns the content\ndescriptor for the computed diff. The diff service is designed to allow clients\nto pull content into snapshotters without requiring the privileges to mount and\nhandle root-owned files.\nSnapshot and Diff Service PR\nDiff implementation PR\nRoadmap for May and June\nWe have a few remaining tasks to finish up in the next few weeks before we consider containerd to be feature complete.\nNamespaces\nWe want the ability to have a single containerd running on a system but allow multiple consumers like Docker, swarmkit, and Kube all consuming the same containerd daemon without stepping on each others containers and images.  We will do this with namespaces.\nclient, err := containerd.NewClient(address, namespace)\n\nPush Support\nRight now we have pull support for fetching content but we need to have the ability to produce content in terms of builds and pushing checkpoints.\nDaemon Wide Events\nWe need to finish the events service so that consumers have a single service that they can consume to handle events produced by containerd, images, and their containers.\nAfter we have these features completed, the majority of the time in June will be spent reviewing the API and client packages so that we have an API we are comfortable supporting in an LTS release.\nWe currently have a few integrations in the works for using containerd with Kube, Swarmkit, and Docker and in June we hope to complete some of these integrations and have testing infrastructure setup for these.\nSo that is the basic plan for the next 6 weeks or so.

We have a couple consumers that are working on containerd implementations such as a CRI for kube, Docker execution, Swarmkit, and Linuxkit consuming containerd.\nWe hope to be feature complete by the end of this month.  That will leave the month of June to focus on quality of the API and making sure that client needs are met.  We have some work on error codes and reviewing our protos to make sure we have an API that we can support for the life of containerd 1.x.\nImage push\nWe added a push and push-object command to the dist tool. The push command\ncan be used to push a manifest and all the related objects to a registry. The\npush-object can push individual blobs from the content store to a registry.\nThe push command does not require first tagging an image, just specify the\nremote name of the image as well as the local name. If the remote and local\nname are the same, only one argument is needed. The remote name may exclude\nthe object identifier (Docker-style tag or digest), in which case the manifest\nmay be repulled using the manifest digest as the object identifier. Push only\nhandles pushing images which already exist, it will not create an image manifest\nif one does not exist. We will add a separate command for creating new images in\nthe future.\nExample pushing image to a local registry.\n$ dist image list\nREF                               TYPE                                                 DIGEST                                                                  SIZE\ndocker.io/library/ubuntu:latest   application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json sha256:382452f82a8bbd34443b2c727650af46aced0f94a44463c62a9848133ecb1aa8 44.7 MiB\n$ dist push localhost:5000/ubuntu docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest\nmanifest-sha256:382452f82a8bbd34443b2c727650af46aced0f94a44463c62a9848133ecb1aa8: done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:cf9722e506aada1109f5c00a9ba542a81c9e109606c01c81f5991b1f93de7b66:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:b6f892c0043b37bd1834a4a1b7d68fe6421c6acbc7e7e63a4527e1d379f92c1b:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:55010f332b047687e081a9639fac04918552c144bc2da4edb3422ce8efcc1fb1:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:3deef3fcbd3072b45771bd0d192d4e5ff2b7310b99ea92bce062e01097953505:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nconfig-sha256:ebcd9d4fca80e9e8afc525d8a38e7c56825dfb4a220ed77156f9fb13b14d4ab7:   done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nlayer-sha256:2955fb827c947b782af190a759805d229cfebc75978dba2d01b4a59e6a333845:    done           |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|\nelapsed: 6.5 s                                                                    total:  44.7 M (6.9 MiB/s)\n#886 Add dist push-object\n#911 Add dist push\nClient\nWe started work on the initial containerd client.  Since we will have multiple consumers using the API, we want to reduce duplicated code for users of containerd.  Another goal for our client is to give users a stable client API that does not feel like they are working with a remote daemon.  Containers are already complex for most people but this does not need to be the case.  Building a platform on top of containerd should be effortless.  We want to handle the low level system aspects so that you can build a platform for your users and not worry about the underlying system, unless you want to.\nCreating a client for Docker\nclient, err := containerd.New(address, containerd.WithNamespace(\"docker\"))\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\ndefer client.Close()\n\nPulling an Image from DockerHub\n// pull && unpack the image to your snapshot ( overlayfs default ) of choice\nimage, err := client.Pull(ctx, \"docker.io/library/redis:alpine\", containerd.WithPullUnpack)\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\n\nGenerate an OCI runtime specification\n// generate the spec based on the image that we pulled\nspec, err := containerd.GenerateSpec(containerd.WithImageConfig(ctx, image))\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\n\nCreate a new container based on the image\n// create the container with a persistent ReadWrite layer based on the image and spec\ncontainer, err := client.NewContainer(ctx, \"redis\", spec, containerd.WithNewRootFS(\"redis-rootfs\", image))\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\ndefer container.Delete(ctx)\n\nRun the container\n// use the current process's stdio\ntask, err := container.NewTask(ctx, containerd.Stdio)\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\ndefer task.Delete(ctx)\n\npid := task.Pid()\n\n// start the redis process\nif err := task.Start(ctx); err != nil {\n    return err\n}\n\ntask.Kill(ctx, syscall.SIGTERM)\n\nstatus, err := task.Wait(ctx)\n\nos.Exit(status)\n\nThis is a very simple but common usecase for containerd.  Pull an image and run a container based on that image.  The client lets you write code, use defer statements and any other logic you want without having to do complex filesystem operations, deal with tar files or setting up root filesystems.  The API is split up and allows you to look into the lifecycle of an executing container without the need to register hooks and provide callbacks.\nOver the next few weeks we will be expanding the client to support the full containerd feature set.\nTesting\nWith the initial client merged into the code base we are also starting work on integration tests.  We have full integration tests running on travis ci.  You don't have to mess with any other test frameworks to write tests for containerd, just the standard Go testing package.\nWe also designed the client to allow mocking of calls so that our tests can be mocked out or users of our client to easily mock their own code for testing.\nYou can view the PR here.\nWhat's Next?\nWe still need to finish Events.  This is one of the last major features that we need before we consider containerd feature complete.  The namespace work is in progress with the initial service spec'd.\nWithin the next few weeks we should have namespaces done, a complete client, and hopefully a stable events service.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-06-09.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-06-09.html","title":"2017 06 09","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for June 09, 2017\nDocker Schema 1 Pull\nWe added support for pulling Docker images which use the schema1 manifest\nformat in the containerd client. This allows pulling images from older\nregistries as well as images pushed from older versions of Docker. With this\nchange any image from the Docker Hub or registry supporting the v2 API can be\npulled. As part of our commitment to support OCI images, the schema 1 images\npulled by the client are converted to OCI images before being stored by\ncontainerd. The containerd client will only support pushing these images as\nOCI.\n#968 Schema 1 pull\nNamespaces for multitenancy\nOne of the goals of containerd is to support multiple consumers.  The ability to have swarm, docker, kube, and more all running on the same system and using the same containerd without having naming and actions conflict with one another.  We have the namespace API merged in and most of the underlying components updated to support namespaces.  You can view the namespace PR below for more information on the functionality of namespaces.\nnamespaces\nClient Updates\nWe added updates to the client to support attach, checkpoint and restore, exec of additional processes, and fixes.  We also ported over the ctr and dist tools to use the client this week.\nexec\ntty\ncheckpoint\nattach\nWhat's Next?\nWe only have a few features left to implement, such as events, for our 1.0 release.  The rest of the month we are working on usability, bug fixes, and stability.\nWe will be helping out with integrations of containerd into other platforms to make sure that everyone has the functionality that they need.  If you run into any problems please open an issue on github.  Also Pull Requests for the problems you are having are welcome.  If you have any question or help working on a change, stop by the #containerd slack channel as everyone is friendly and helpful.\n"},"historical/reports/2017-06-23.html":{"url":"historical/reports/2017-06-23.html","title":"2017 06 23","keywords":"","body":"Development Report for June 23, 2017\nEvents Service\nWe added an events service for getting events across various services including\ncontainers, content, execution, images, namespaces, and snapshots.

The\nfilter package defines a syntax and parser that can be used across types and\nuse cases in a uniform manner. This will be used commonly across the API for\nimages, containers, events, snapshots, etc.\nThe syntax is fairly familiar, if you've used container ecosystem\nprojects.  At the core, we base it on the concept of protobuf field\npaths, augmenting with the ability to quote portions of the field path\nto match arbitrary labels. These \"selectors\" come in the following\nsyntax:\n[]\nA basic example is as follows:\nname==foo\nThis would match all objects that have a field name with the value\nfoo. If we only want to test if the field is present, we can omit the\noperator. This is most useful for matching labels in containerd. The\nfollowing will match objects that has the field labels and have the\nlabel \"foo\" defined:\nlabels.foo\nWe also allow for quoting of parts of the field path to allow matching\nof arbitrary items:\nlabels.\"very complex label\"==something\nWe also define != and ~= as operators. The != operator will match\nall objects that don't match the value for a field and ~= will compile\nthe target value as a regular expression and match the field value\nagainst that.\nSelectors can be combined using a comma, such that the resulting\nselector will require all selectors are matched for the object to match.\nThe following example will match objects that are named foo and have\nthe label bar:\nname==foo,labels.bar\n#995: Add package for filters\n#1050: Container list filters\n#1069: Event filters\nSupport for pushing and pulling OCI indexes\nWe added support for pushing and pulling OCI indexes. Currently all content\nreferenced by the list are pulled and further work on the client will be done\nto allow selection of the pulled manifest to extract and run.\n#1022: Support pull for OCI indexes\nSnapshot list\nWe added ctr snapshot list to snapshots from containerd.

Always remember that\nthese summit round tables are not the only opportunity to have these topics\ndiscussed and everyone is encouraged to open issues and engage the community on\nSlack.\n\n\"What are the plans for a resolver-resolver and image reference namespacing?\"\n\nMaintainers are trying to figure out what everyone’s plans/needs are for a resolver-resolver.\nA resolver-resolver allows configuring where push/pull happens. Could take in a configuration format which specifies how to push, pull, and authenticate. Needed in order to do discover of names to registry configurations.\nStephen confirms we are thinking of more configuration driven rather programmatic. The resolver-resolver and any configuration is always client side, allowing the integrator to design any interface or configuration suits their needs. But we are also looking to define something that could be consistently applied by containerd clients.\nThe resolver-resolver will be compatible with Docker, but could allow Docker to expand its resolution support.\n\n\n\"What is the plan for garbage collection?\"\n\nCurrent design is oriented around being garbage collected. The data model is designed around references which are used to walk a root set. Everything unreferenced would be garbage collected.\nAnother more complicated aspect of garbage collection is around policy, allowing to clean up resources based on age or client specified policies.\nClient side implementations would allow establishing policies.\nContainerd will require a stop the world to do the garbage collection.\nA heavy delete which does not garbage collect is an option and similar to to the interface today. The API does not guarantee that disk is cleaned up after a deletion, only that the resource is freed. Inline deletion would require reference counting to know when to delete. This would also require global locking to protect the references.\nHow to handle content which is active but unreferenced, leasing vs pre-allocate. This has not been decided on.\n\n\n\"What will need to change in Docker in regards to graphdrivers for accommodating the containerd snapshotters?\"\n\nThe goal is to have graphdrivers be able to be used as snapshot drivers.\nTo accomplish this graphdrivers need to be able to return mounts without needing to require action on unmount. Unmount will no longer contact the graphdriver since snapshotters to do not control the mount/unmount lifecycle.\nFor implementation, in the repository tree only overlayfs and btrfs are supported. Everything else will be out of tree and require special builds or proxying.\n\n\n\"Version numbers on events and API objects\"\n\nAre objects mutable? Some objects are mutable but not necessarily relevant to clients.\nAre containers mutable? It can have multiple tasks, can be started and stopped.\nWe may need to have task id separate from the container to differentiate between tasks within a container.\nTasks have a pid which could be used to identify the task. Someone had a customer that ran out of memory from running too many tasks, could be caused by repeated execs in the same container.\nGetting state of a containers task involves requesting containers and tasks, or just tasks could be listed.\nWhat are the API costs, is there measurements of the cost of API calls and comparisons with Docker? Calling docker ps can be expensive due to locks, containerd should be much cheaper and faster to call. This need to be verified and measurements added.\n\n\n\"How can clients understand the capabilities of the containerd instance it is talking to?\"\n\nAs an orchestrator, interested in understanding what can be done with the plugins. Example, docker log drivers change feature set but the log driver names do not change. Stuck on checking docker version.\nThere have been problems in the past with requiring multiple clients of docker to handle changes.\nGRPC is adding introspection, plan is to wait for this work rather than making something ourselves.\nThe maintainers would like to understand what were the really bad changes in Docker that caused problems with version support for users. Problems around needing to bump the whole API to get a new feature. Containerd API versions each service and v1 interface will be stable and supported.\n\n\n\n"},"man/containerd-config.8.html":{"url":"man/containerd-config.8.html","title":"containerd-config.8","keywords":"","body":"containerd-config 8 01/30/2018\nNAME\ncontainerd-config - information on the containerd config\nSYNOPSIS\ncontainerd config [command]\nDESCRIPTION\nThe containerd config command has one subcommand, named default, which\nwill display on standard output the default containerd config for this version\nof the containerd daemon.\nThis output can be piped to a containerd-config.toml(5) file and placed in\n/etc/containerd to be used as the configuration for containerd on daemon\nstartup.

On Ubuntu, it can be installed with apt-get install dmsetup command.\nHow to setup Device-Mapper thin-pool\nThere are many ways how to configure a Device-mapper thin-pool depending on your requirements, disk configuration,\nand environment. Two common configurations are provided below, one for development environments and one for\nproduction environments.\n1. Loopback Devices\nOn local dev environment you can utilize loopback devices. This type of configuration is simple and suits well for\ndevelopment and testing (please note that this configuration is slow and not recommended for production uses).\nRun the following script to create a thin-pool device with associated metadata and data device files:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -ex\n\nDATA_DIR=/var/lib/containerd/devmapper\nPOOL_NAME=devpool\n\nsudo mkdir -p ${DATA_DIR}\n\n# Create data file\nsudo touch \"${DATA_DIR}/data\"\nsudo truncate -s 100G \"${DATA_DIR}/data\"\n\n# Create metadata file\nsudo touch \"${DATA_DIR}/meta\"\nsudo truncate -s 10G \"${DATA_DIR}/meta\"\n\n# Allocate loop devices\nDATA_DEV=$(sudo losetup --find --show \"${DATA_DIR}/data\")\nMETA_DEV=$(sudo losetup --find --show \"${DATA_DIR}/meta\")\n\n# Define thin-pool parameters.\n# See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/device-mapper/thin-provisioning.txt for details.\nSECTOR_SIZE=512\nDATA_SIZE=\"$(sudo blockdev --getsize64 -q ${DATA_DEV})\"\nLENGTH_IN_SECTORS=$(bc \nUse dmsetup to verify that the thin-pool was created successfully:\nsudo dmsetup ls\ndevpool    (253:0)\n\nOnce containerd is configured and restarted, you'll see the following output:\nINFO[2020-03-17T20:24:45.532604888Z] loading plugin \"io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.devmapper\"...  type=io.containerd.snapshotter.v1\nINFO[2020-03-17T20:24:45.532672738Z] initializing pool device \"devpool\"\n2. direct-lvm thin-pool\nAnother way to setup a thin-pool is via the container-storage-setup\ntool (formerly known as docker-storage-setup). It is a script to configure CoW file systems like devicemapper:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -ex\n\n# Block device to use for devmapper thin-pool\nBLOCK_DEV=/dev/sdf\nPOOL_NAME=devpool\nVG_NAME=containerd\n\n#

Opts","keywords":"","body":"Client options\nThe containerd client was built to be easily extended by consumers.\nThe goal is that the execution flow of the calls remain the same across implementations while Opts are written to extend functionality.\nTo accomplish this we depend on the Opts pattern in Go.\nMethod Calls\nFor many functions and methods within the client package you will generally see variadic args as the last parameter.\nIf we look at the NewContainer method on the client we can see that it has a required argument of id and then additional NewContainerOpts.\nThere are a few built in options that allow the container to be created with an existing spec, WithSpec, and snapshot opts for creating or using an existing snapshot.\nfunc (c *Client) NewContainer(ctx context.Context, id string, opts ...NewContainerOpts) (Container, error) {\n}\n\nExtending the Client\nAs a consumer of the containerd client you need to be able to add your domain specific functionality.\nThere are a few ways of doing this, changing the client code, submitting a PR to the containerd client, or forking the client.\nThese ways of extending the client should only be considered after every other method has been tried.\nThe proper and supported way of extending the client is to build a package of Opts that define your application specific logic.\nAs an example, if Docker is integrating containerd support and needs to add concepts such as Volumes, they would create a docker package with options.\nBad Extension Example\n// example code\ncontainer, err := client.NewContainer(ctx, id)\n\n// add volumes with their config and bind mounts\ncontainer.Labels[\"volumes\"] = VolumeConfig{}\ncontainer.Spec.Binds  = append({\"/var/lib/docker/volumes...\"})\n\nGood Extension Example\n// example code\nimport \"github.com/docker/docker\"\nimport \"github.com/docker/libnetwork\"\n\ncontainer, err := client.NewContainer(ctx, id,\n    docker.WithVolume(\"volume-name\"),\n    libnetwork.WithOverlayNetwork(\"cluster-network\"),\n)\n\nThere are a few advantages using this model.\n\nYour application code is not scattered in the execution flow of the containerd client.\nYour code can be unit tested without mocking the containerd client.\nContributors can better follow your containerd implementation and understand when and where your application logic is added to standard containerd client calls.\n\nExample SpecOpt\nIf we want to make a SpecOpt to setup a container to monitor the host system with htop it can be easily done without ever touching a line of code in the containerd repository.\npackage monitor\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/containerd/containerd/oci\"\n    specs \"github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/specs-go\"\n)\n\n// WithHtop configures a container to monitor the host system via `htop`\nfunc WithHtop(s *specs.Spec) error {\n    // make sure we are in the host pid namespace\n    if err := oci.WithHostNamespace(specs.PIDNamespace)(s); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    // make sure we set htop as our arg\n    s.Process.Args = []string{\"htop\"}\n    // make sure we have a tty set for htop\n    if err := oci.WithTTY(s); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nAdding your new option to spec generation is as easy as importing your new package and adding the option when creating a spec.\nimport \"github.com/crosbymichael/monitor\"\n\ncontainer, err := client.NewContainer(ctx, id,\n    containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image), monitor.WithHtop),\n)\n\nYou can see the full code and

content can be used for executing containers.\nIn order to execute on that flow, containerd requires content and to manage it.\nThis document describes how content flows into containerd, how it is managed, and where it exists\nat each stage in the process. We use an example of going from a known image\ndocker.io/library/redis:5.0.9 to explore the\nflow of content.\nContent Areas\nContent exists in several areas in the containerd lifecycle:\n\nOCI registry, for example hub.docker.com or quay.io\ncontainerd content store, under containerd's local storage space, for example, on a standard Linux installation at /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.content.v1.content\nsnapshots, under containerd's local storage space, for example, on a standard Linux installation at /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.. For an overlayfs snapshotter, that would be at /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs\n\nIn order to create a container, the following must occur:\n\nThe image and all its content must be loaded into the content store. This normally happens via download from the OCI registry, but you can load content in directly as well.\nCommitted snapshots must be created from each layer of content for the image.\nAn active snapshot must be created on top of the final layer of content for the image.\n\nA container now can be created, with its root filesystem as the active snapshot.\nThe rest of this document looks at the content in each area in detail, and how they relate to one another.\nImage Format\nImages in a registry normally are stored in the following format. An \"image\" is comprised of a JSON document\nknown as a descriptor. A descriptor always contains an element, mediaType, which tells us which type it is. It is one of two options:\n\na \"manifest\", which lists the hashes of the config file for running the image as a container, and the binary data layers that create the filesystem for the image\nan \"index\", which lists the hashes of manifests, one per platform, where a platform is a combination of architecture (e.g. amd64 or arm64) and operating system (e.g. linux)\n\nThe purpose of an index is to allow us to pick which manifest matches our target platform.\nTo convert an image reference, such as redis:5.0.9, from a registry to actual on-disk storage, we:\n\nRetrieve the descriptor (JSON document) for the image\nDetermine from the mediaType if the descriptor is a manifest or an index:\nIf the descriptor is an index, find in it the platform (architecture+os) that represents the platform on which we want to run the container, use that hash to retrieve the manifest\nIf the descriptor already is a manifest, continue\n\n\nFor each element in the manifest - the config and one or more layers - use the hash listed to retrieve the components and save them\n\nWe use our example image, redis:5.0.9, to clarify the process.\nWhen we first resolve redis:5.0.9, we get the following JSON document:\n{\n    \"manifests\": [\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:9bb13890319dc01e5f8a4d3d0c4c72685654d682d568350fd38a02b1d70aee6b\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"amd64\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1572\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:aeb53f8db8c94d2cd63ca860d635af4307967aa11a2fdead98ae0ab3a329f470\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"arm\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\",\n                \"variant\": \"v5\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1573\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:17dc42e40d4af0a9e84c738313109f3a95e598081beef6c18a05abb57337aa5d\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"arm\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\",\n                \"variant\": \"v7\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1573\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:613f4797d2b6653634291a990f3e32378c7cfe3cdd439567b26ca340b8946013\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"arm64\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\",\n                \"variant\": \"v8\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1573\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:ee0e1f8d8d338c9506b0e487ce6c2c41f931d1e130acd60dc7794c3a246eb59e\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"386\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1572\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:1072145f8eea186dcedb6b377b9969d121a00e65ae6c20e9cd631483178ea7ed\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"mips64le\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1572\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:4b7860fcaea5b9bbd6249c10a3dc02a5b9fb339e8aef17a542d6126a6af84d96\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"ppc64le\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1573\n        },\n        {\n            \"digest\": \"sha256:d66dfc869b619cd6da5b5ae9d7b1cbab44c134b31d458de07f7d580a84b63f69\",\n            \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n            \"platform\": {\n                \"architecture\": \"s390x\",\n                \"os\": \"linux\"\n            },\n            \"size\": 1573\n        }\n    ],\n    \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json\",\n    \"schemaVersion\": 2\n}\n\nThe descriptor above, towards the end, shows that the mediaType is a \"manifest.list\", or in OCI parlance, an index.\nIt has an array field called manifests, each element of which lists one platform and the hash of the manifest for that platform.\nThe \"platform\" is a combination of \"architecture\" and \"os\".

You can get the same value\nby doing:\n$ cat  | gunzip - | sha256sum -\n\nFor example:\n$ cat /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.content.v1.content/blobs/sha256/1ed3521a5dcbd05214eb7f35b952ecf018d5a6610c32ba4e315028c556f45e94 | gunzip - | sha256sum -\n832f21763c8e6b070314e619ebb9ba62f815580da6d0eaec8a1b080bd01575f7\n\nThat aligns precisely with the last layer:\nsha256:1ed3521a5dcbd05214eb7f35b952ecf018d5a6610c32ba4e315028c556f45e94 1.732kB 20 minutes      containerd.io/distribution.source.docker.io=library/redis,containerd.io/uncompressed=sha256:832f21763c8e6b070314e619ebb9ba62f815580da6d0eaec8a1b080bd01575f7\nConfig Labels\nWe have a single config layer, sha256:987b553c835f01f46eb1859bc32f564119d5833801a27b25a0ca5c6b8b6e111a. It has a label prefixed with containerd.io/gc.ref. indicating\nthat it is a label that impacts garbage collection.\nIn this case, the label is containerd.io/gc.ref.snapshot.overlayfs and has a value of sha256:33bd296ab7f37bdacff0cb4a5eb671bcb3a141887553ec4157b1e64d6641c1cd.\nThis is used to connect this config to a snapshot. We will look at that shortly when we discuss snapshots.\nManifest Labels\nThe labels on the manifest also begin with containerd.io/gc.ref, indicating that they are used to control\ngarbage collection. A manifest has several \"children\". These normally are the config and the layers. We want\nto ensure that as long as the image remains around, i.e. the manifest, the children do not get garbage collected.\nThus, we have labels referencing each child:\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.config references the config\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l. reference the layers\n\nIn our example, the manifest is sha256:9bb13890319dc01e5f8a4d3d0c4c72685654d682d568350fd38a02b1d70aee6b, and the labels are as follows.\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.config=sha256:df57482065789980ee9445b1dd79ab1b7b3d1dc26b6867d94470af969a64c8e6\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l.0=sha256:97481c7992ebf6f22636f87e4d7b79e962f928cdbe6f2337670fa6c9a9636f04\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l.1=sha256:5999b99cee8f2875d391d64df20b6296b63f23951a7d41749f028375e887cd05\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l.2=sha256:bfee6cb5fdad6b60ec46297f44542ee9d8ac8f01c072313a51cd7822df3b576f\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l.3=sha256:fd36a1ebc6728807cbb1aa7ef24a1861343c6dc174657721c496613c7b53bd07\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l.4=sha256:bb79b6b2107fea8e8a47133a660b78e3a546998fcf0427be39ac9a0af4a97e90\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.l.5=sha256:1ed3521a5dcbd05214eb7f35b952ecf018d5a6610c32ba4e315028c556f45e94\nThese are precisely those children of the manifest - the config and layers - that are stored in our content store.\nIndex Labels\nThe labels on the index also begin with containerd.io/gc.ref, indicating that they are used to control\ngarbage collection. An index has several \"children\", i.e. the manifests, one for each platform, as discussed above.\nWe want to ensure that as long as the index remains around, the children do not get garbage collected.\nThus, we have labels referencing each child, containerd.io/gc.ref.content.m..\nIn our example, the index is sha256:2a9865e55c37293b71df051922022898d8e4ec0f579c9b53a0caee1b170bc81c, and the labels are as follows:\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.0=sha256:9bb13890319dc01e5f8a4d3d0c4c72685654d682d568350fd38a02b1d70aee6b\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.1=sha256:aeb53f8db8c94d2cd63ca860d635af4307967aa11a2fdead98ae0ab3a329f470\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.2=sha256:17dc42e40d4af0a9e84c738313109f3a95e598081beef6c18a05abb57337aa5d\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.3=sha256:613f4797d2b6653634291a990f3e32378c7cfe3cdd439567b26ca340b8946013\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.4=sha256:ee0e1f8d8d338c9506b0e487ce6c2c41f931d1e130acd60dc7794c3a246eb59e\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.5=sha256:1072145f8eea186dcedb6b377b9969d121a00e65ae6c20e9cd631483178ea7ed\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.6=sha256:4b7860fcaea5b9bbd6249c10a3dc02a5b9fb339e8aef17a542d6126a6af84d96\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.m.7=sha256:d66dfc869b619cd6da5b5ae9d7b1cbab44c134b31d458de07f7d580a84b63f69\nNotice that there are 8 children to the index, but all of them are for platforms other than ours, linux/amd64,\nand thus only one of them, sha256:9bb13890319dc01e5f8a4d3d0c4c72685654d682d568350fd38a02b1d70aee6b actually is\nin our content store. That doesn't hurt; it just means that the others will not be garbage collected either. Since\nthey aren't there, they won't be removed.\nSnapshots\nThe content in the content store is immutable, but also in formats that often are unusable. For example,\nmost container layers are in a tar-gzip format. One cannot simply mount a tar-gzip file. Even if one could,\nwe want to leave our immutable content not only unchanged, but unchangeable, even by accident, i.e. immutable.\nIn order to use it, we create snapshots of the content.\nThe process is as follows:\n\nThe snapshotter creates a snapshot from the parent. In the case of the first layer, that is blank. This is now an \"active\" snapshot.\nThe diff applier, which has knowledge of the internal format of the layer blob, applies the layer blob to the active snapshot.\nThe snapshotter commits the snapshot after the diff has been applied. This is now a \"committed\" snapshot.\nThe committed snapshot is used as the parent for the next layer.\n\nReturning to our example, each layer will have a corresponding immutable snapshot layer. Recalling that\nour example has 6 layers, we expect to see 6 committed snapshots. The output has been sorted to make viewing\neasier; it matches the layers from the content store and manifest itself.\n$ ctr snapshot ls\nKEY                                                                     PARENT                                                                  KIND\nsha256:d0fe97fa8b8cefdffcef1d62b65aba51a6c87b6679628a2b50fc6a7a579f764c                                                                         Committed\nsha256:2ae5fa95c0fce5ef33fbb87a7e2f49f2a56064566a37a83b97d3f668c10b43d6 sha256:d0fe97fa8b8cefdffcef1d62b65aba51a6c87b6679628a2b50fc6a7a579f764c Committed\nsha256:a8f09c4919857128b1466cc26381de0f9d39a94171534f63859a662d50c396ca sha256:2ae5fa95c0fce5ef33fbb87a7e2f49f2a56064566a37a83b97d3f668c10b43d6 Committed\nsha256:aa4b58e6ece416031ce00869c5bf4b11da800a397e250de47ae398aea2782294 sha256:a8f09c4919857128b1466cc26381de0f9d39a94171534f63859a662d50c396ca Committed\nsha256:bc8b010e53c5f20023bd549d082c74ef8bfc237dc9bbccea2e0552e52bc5fcb1 sha256:aa4b58e6ece416031ce00869c5bf4b11da800a397e250de47ae398aea2782294 Committed\nsha256:33bd296ab7f37bdacff0cb4a5eb671bcb3a141887553ec4157b1e64d6641c1cd sha256:bc8b010e53c5f20023bd549d082c74ef8bfc237dc9bbccea2e0552e52bc5fcb1 Committed\n\nParents\nEach snapshot has a parent, except for the root. It is a tree, or a stacked cake, starting with the first layer.\nThis matches how the layers are built, as layers.\nName\nThe key, or name, for the snapshot does not match the hash from the content store. This is because the hash from the\ncontent store is the hash of the original content, in this case tar-gzipped. The snapshot expands it out into the\nfilesystem to make it useful. It also does not match the uncompressed content, i.e. the tar file without gzip, and as\ngiven on the label containerd.io/uncompressed.\nRather the name is the result of applying the layer to the previous one and hashing it. By that logic, the very root\nof the tree, the first layer, should have the same hash and name as the uncompressed value of the first layer blob.\nIndeed, it does. The root layer is sha256:bb79b6b2107fea8e8a47133a660b78e3a546998fcf0427be39ac9a0af4a97e90\nwhich, when uncompressed, has the value sha256:d0fe97fa8b8cefdffcef1d62b65aba51a6c87b6679628a2b50fc6a7a579f764c,\nwhich is the first layer in the snapshot, and also the label on that layer in the content store:\nsha256:bb79b6b2107fea8e8a47133a660b78e3a546998fcf0427be39ac9a0af4a97e90 27.09MB 19 minutes      containerd.io/distribution.source.docker.io=library/redis,containerd.io/uncompressed=sha256:d0fe97fa8b8cefdffcef1d62b65aba51a6c87b6679628a2b50fc6a7a579f764c\nFinal Layer\nThe final, or top, layer, is the point at which you would want to create an active snapshot to start a container.\nThus, we would need to track it. This is exactly the label that is placed on the config. In our example, the\nconfig is at sha256:987b553c835f01f46eb1859bc32f564119d5833801a27b25a0ca5c6b8b6e111a and had the label\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.snapshot.overlayfs=sha256:33bd296ab7f37bdacff0cb4a5eb671bcb3a141887553ec4157b1e64d6641c1cd.\nLooking at our snapshots, the value of the final layer of the stack is, indeed, that:\nsha256:33bd296ab7f37bdacff0cb4a5eb671bcb3a141887553ec4157b1e64d6641c1cd sha256:bc8b010e53c5f20023bd549d082c74ef8bfc237dc9bbccea2e0552e52bc5fcb1 Committed\nNote as well, that the label on the config in the content store starts with containerd.io/gc.ref. This is\na garbage collection label. It is this label that keeps the garbage collector from removing the snapshot.\nBecause the config has a reference to it, the top layer is \"protected\" from garbage collection. This layer,\nin turn, depends on the next layer down, so it is protected from collection, and so on until the root or base layer.\nContainer\nWith the above in place, we know how to create an active snapshot that is useful for the container. We simply\nneed to Prepare() the active snapshot,\npassing it an ID and the parent, in this case the top layer of committed snapshots.\nThus, the steps are:\n\nGet the content into the content store, either via Pull(), or via loading it in the content.Store API\nUnpack the image to create committed snapshots for each layer, using image.Unpack(). Alternatively, if you use Pull(), you can pass it an option to unpack when pulling, using WithPullUnpack()\nCreate an active snapshot using Prepare(). You can skip this step if you plan on creating a container, as you can pass it as an option to the next step.\nCreate a container using NewContainer(), optionally telling it to create a snapshot with WithNewSnapshot()\n\n"},"garbage-collection.html":{"url":"garbage-collection.html","title":"Garbage Collection","keywords":"","body":"Garbage Collection\ncontainerd has a garbage collector capable of removing resources which are no\nlonger being used. The client is responsible for ensuring that all resources\nwhich are created are either used or held by a lease at all times, else they\nwill be considered eligible for removal. The Go client library\n(github.com/containerd/containerd) has built-in behavior to ensure resources\nare properly tracked and leased. However, the lifecycles of leases are the\nresponsibility of the caller of the library. The containerd daemon has strict\nresource management and will garbage collect any unused resource.\nWhat is a lease?\nLeases are a resource in containerd which are created by clients and are used\nto reference other resources such as snapshots and content. Leases may be\nconfigured with an expiration or deleted by clients once it has completed an\noperation. Leases are needed to inform the containerd daemon that a resource\nmay be used in the future after the client completes an operation, even though\nit currently is not seen as utilized.\nHow to use leases\nusing Go client\nThe best way to use leases is to add it to a Go context immediately after the\ncontext is created. Normally the lifespan of a lease will be the same as the\nlifecycle of a Go context.\n    ctx, done, err := client.WithLease(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    defer done(ctx)\n\nThis will create a lease which will defer its own deletion and have a default\nexpiry of 24 hours (in case the process dies before defer). For most use cases,\nthis is enough and no more thought needs to be put into leases.\nBut, of course, more complicated use cases are supported...\nIf the program or lease are intended to be longer lived, instead of the very\neasy client.WithLease, the lease manager can be used directly. This also\nallows for setting custom labels on the lease or manipulating its resources.\nUse client.LeasesService() to get a lease Manager\nwhich can be used to create, list, and delete leases as well as manage the\nreferenced resources for that lease.\n    manager := client.LeasesService()\n\n    // this lease will never expire\n    // Use `leases.WithExpiration` to make it expire\n    // Use `leases.WithLabels` to apply any labels\n    l, err := manager.Create(ctx, leases.WithRandomID())\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    // Update current context to add lease\n    ctx = leases.WithLease(ctx, l.ID)\n\n    // Do something, lease will be used...\n\n    // Delete lease at any time, or track it to delete later\n    if err := ls.Delete(ctx, l); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\nusing gRPC\nThe lease is not an explicit field in the API (except of course the leases\nservice), but rather an optional field any API service can use. Leases can\nbe set on any gRPC service endpoint using a gRPC header. Set the\ngRPC header containerd-lease to the lease identifier and the API\nservice will operate within that lease context.\nTo manage the creation and deletion of leases, use the leases gRPC service.\nGarbage Collection labels\nThe garbage collection defines relationships between resources in two different\nways, by type specific resources properties, and by resource labels. The type\nspecific properties do not need to be managed by the user as they are part of\nthe natural structure of a resource (i.e. a container's snapshot, a snapshot's\nparent, an image's target, etc). However resources may have relationships which\nare not defined by containerd, but rather by the client. For example, an OCI\nimage has a manifest which references a config file and layer tars. These\nresources are stored in containerd as generic blobs, it is the client that\nunderstands the relationships between these blobs and sets them up using labels\non the content resources.\nResource labels can also be used to cue the garbage collector on other\nproperties, such as expiry, whether an object should be kept without any\nreference or limit what is referenced.\nThe supported garbage collection labels are:\n\n\n\nLabel key\nLabel value\nSupported Resources\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.root\nnonempty\nContent, Snapshots\nKeep this object and anything it references. (Clients may set this to a rfc3339 timestamp to indicate when this value was set, however, the garbage collector does not parse the value)\n\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.snapshot.\n\nContent, Snapshots\nResource references the given snapshot  for the snapshotter \n\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content\ndigest\nContent, Snapshots, Images, Containers\nResource references the given content blob\n\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.ref.content.\ndigest\nContent, Snapshots, Images, Containers\nResource references the given content blob with a  label key\n\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.expire\ntimestamp formatted as rfc3339\nLeases\nWhen to expire the lease. The garbage collector will delete the lease after expiration.\n\n\ncontainerd.io/gc.flat\nnonempty\nLeases\nIgnore label references of leased resources. This only applies when the reference is originating from the lease, if the leased resources are referenced elsewhere, then their label references will be used.\n\n\n\nGarbage Collection configuration\nThe garbage collector (gc) is scheduled on a background goroutine and runs based\non a number of configurable factors. By default the garbage collector will\nattempt to keep the database unlocked 98% of the time based on prior\ncalculations of lock time from garbage collection. Also by default, the garbage\ncollector will not schedule itself if no deletions occurred or after every 100\ndatabase writes.\nThe garbage collection scheduler considers the time the database is locked\nas the pause time. The garbage collection will take longer than this when\nresources are being removed, for example cleaning up snapshots may be slow.\nThe scheduler will only schedule after the whole garbage collection is\ncompleted but use the average pause time for determining when the next run\nattempt is.\nGarbage collection may be configured using the containerd daemon's\nconfiguration file, usually at /etc/containerd/config.toml. The\nconfiguration is under the scheduler plugin.\nConfiguration parameters\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npause_threshold\n0.02\nRepresents the maximum amount of time gc should be scheduled based on the average pause time. A maximum value of .5 (50%) is enforced to prevent over scheduling.\n\n\ndeletion_threshold\n0\nA threshold of number of deletes to immediately trigger gc. 0 means a gc will not be triggered by deletion count, however a deletion will ensure the next scheduled gc will run.\n\n\nmutation_threshold\n100\nA threshold for running gc after the given number of database mutations. Note any mutation which performed a delete will always cause gc to run, this case handles more rare events such as label reference removal.\n\n\nschedule_delay\n\"0ms\"\nThe delay between a trigger event and running gc. A non-zero value can be used when mutations may quickly burst.\n\n\nstartup_delay\n\"100ms\"\nThe delay before running the initial garbage collection after daemon startup. This should be run after other startup processes have completed and no gc can be scheduled before this delay.\n\n\n\nThe default configuration is represented as...\nversion = 2\n[plugins]\n  [plugins.\"io.containerd.gc.v1.scheduler\"]\n    pause_threshold = 0.02\n    deletion_threshold = 0\n    mutation_threshold = 100\n    schedule_delay = \"0ms\"\n    startup_delay = \"100ms\"\n\nSynchronous Garbage Collection\nIn addition to garbage collections done through the scheduler, the client\nmay also request a garbage collection during resource removal. In this case,\nthe garbage collection will be scheduled immediately (or after schedule_delay\nwhen configured to non-zero). The service will not return until the garbage\ncollection has completed.

err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc redisExample() error {\n    client, err := containerd.New(\"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\")\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    defer client.Close()\n    return nil\n}\n\nThis will create a new client with the default containerd socket path.\nBecause we are working with a daemon over GRPC we need to create a context for use with calls to client methods.\ncontainerd is also namespaced for callers of the API.\nWe should also set a namespace for our guide after creating the context.\n    ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), \"example\")\n\nHaving a namespace for our usage ensures that containers, images, and other resources without containerd do not conflict with other users of a single daemon.\nPulling the redis image\nNow that we have a client to work with we need to pull an image.\nWe can use the redis image based on Alpine Linux from the DockerHub.\n    image, err := client.Pull(ctx, \"docker.io/library/redis:alpine\", containerd.WithPullUnpack)\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\nThe containerd client uses the Opts pattern for many of the method calls.\nWe use the containerd.WithPullUnpack so that we not only fetch and download the content into containerd's content store but also unpack it into a snapshotter for use as a root filesystem.\nLet's put the code together that will pull the redis image based on alpine linux from Dockerhub and then print the name of the image on the console's output.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \"context\"\n        \"log\"\n\n        \"github.com/containerd/containerd\"\n        \"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n        if err := redisExample(); err != nil {\n                log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n}\n\nfunc redisExample() error {\n        client, err := containerd.New(\"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\")\n        if err != nil {\n                return err\n        }\n        defer client.Close()\n\n        ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), \"example\")\n        image, err := client.Pull(ctx, \"docker.io/library/redis:alpine\", containerd.WithPullUnpack)\n        if err != nil {\n                return err\n        }\n        log.Printf(\"Successfully pulled %s image\\n\", image.Name())\n\n        return nil\n}\n\n> go build main.go\n> sudo ./main\n\n2017/08/13 17:43:21 Successfully pulled docker.io/library/redis:alpine image\n\nCreating an OCI Spec and Container\nNow that we have an image to base our container off of, we need to generate an OCI runtime specification that the container can be based off of as well as the new container.\ncontainerd provides reasonable defaults for generating OCI runtime specs.\nThere is also an Opt for modifying the default config based on the image that we pulled.\nThe container will be based off of the image, and we will:\n\nallocate a new read-write snapshot so the container can store any persistent information.\ncreate a new spec for the container.\n\n    container, err := client.NewContainer(\n        ctx,\n        \"redis-server\",\n        containerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"redis-server-snapshot\", image),\n        containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),\n    )\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    defer container.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithSnapshotCleanup)\n\nIf you have an existing OCI specification created you can use containerd.WithSpec(spec) to set it on the container.\nWhen creating a new snapshot for the container we need to provide a snapshot ID as well as the Image that the container will be based on.\nBy providing a separate snapshot ID than the container ID we can easily reuse, existing snapshots across different containers.\nWe also add a line to delete the container along with its snapshot after we are done with this example.\nHere is example code to pull the redis image based on alpine linux from Dockerhub, create an OCI spec, create a container based on the spec and finally delete the container.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \"context\"\n        \"log\"\n\n        \"github.com/containerd/containerd\"\n        \"github.com/containerd/containerd/oci\"\n        \"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n        if err := redisExample(); err != nil {\n                log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n}\n\nfunc redisExample() error {\n        client, err := containerd.New(\"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\")\n        if err != nil {\n                return err\n        }\n        defer client.Close()\n\n        ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), \"example\")\n        image, err := client.Pull(ctx, \"docker.io/library/redis:alpine\", containerd.WithPullUnpack)\n        if err != nil {\n                return err\n        }\n        log.Printf(\"Successfully pulled %s image\\n\", image.Name())\n\n        container, err := client.NewContainer(\n                ctx,\n                \"redis-server\",\n                containerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"redis-server-snapshot\", image),\n                containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),\n        )\n        if err != nil {\n                return err\n        }\n        defer container.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithSnapshotCleanup)\n        log.Printf(\"Successfully created container with ID %s and snapshot with ID redis-server-snapshot\", container.ID())\n\n        return nil\n}\n\nLet's see it in action.\n> go build main.go\n> sudo ./main\n\n2017/08/13 18:01:35 Successfully pulled docker.io/library/redis:alpine image\n2017/08/13 18:01:35 Successfully created container with ID redis-server and snapshot with ID redis-server-snapshot\n\nCreating a running Task\nOne thing that may be confusing at first for new containerd users is the separation between a Container and a Task.\nA container is a metadata object that resources are allocated and attached to.\nA task is a live, running process on the system.\nTasks should be deleted after each run while a container can be used, updated, and queried multiple times.\n    task, err := container.NewTask(ctx, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    defer task.Delete(ctx)\n\nThe new task that we just created is actually a running process on your system.\nWe use cio.WithStdio so that all IO from the container is sent to our main.go process.\nThis is a cio.Opt that configures the Streams used by NewCreator to return a cio.IO\nfor the new task.\nIf you are familiar with the OCI runtime actions, the task is currently in the \"created\" state.\nThis means that the namespaces, root filesystem, and various container level settings have been initialized but the user defined process, in this example \"redis-server\", has not been started.\nThis gives users a chance to setup network interfaces or attach different tools to monitor the container.\ncontainerd also takes this opportunity to monitor your container as well.\nWaiting on things like the container's exit status and cgroup metrics are setup at this point.\nIf you are familiar with prometheus you can curl the containerd metrics endpoint (in the config.toml that we created) to see your container's metrics:\n> curl 127.0.0.1:1338/v1/metrics\n\nPretty cool right?\nTask Wait and Start\nNow that we have a task in the created state we need to make sure that we wait on the task to exit.\nIt is essential to wait for the task to finish so that we can close our example and cleanup the resources that we created.\nYou always want to make sure you Wait before calling Start on a task.\nThis makes sure that you do not encounter any races if the task has a simple program like /bin/true that exits promptly after calling start.\n    exitStatusC, err := task.Wait(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    if err := task.Start(ctx); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\nNow we should see the redis-server logs in our terminal when we run the main.go file.\nKilling the task\nSince we are running a long running server we will need to kill the task in order to exit out of our example.\nTo do this we will simply call Kill on the task after waiting a couple of seconds so we have a chance to see the redis-server logs.\n    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)\n\n    if err := task.Kill(ctx, syscall.SIGTERM); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    status := \nWe wait on our exit status channel that we setup to ensure the task has fully exited and we get the exit status.\nIf you have to reload containers or miss waiting on a task, Delete will also return the exit status when you finally delete the task.\nWe got you covered.\nstatus, err := task.Delete(ctx)\n\nFull Example\nHere is the full example that we just put together.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"syscall\"\n    \"time\"\n\n    \"github.com/containerd/containerd\"\n    \"github.com/containerd/containerd/cio\"\n    \"github.com/containerd/containerd/oci\"\n    \"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    if err := redisExample();

Note: Updates under this directory do not\nrequire restarting the containerd daemon.\nRegistry API Support\nAll configured registry hosts are expected to comply with the OCI Distribution Specification.\nRegistries which are non-compliant or implement non-standard behavior are not guaranteed\nto be supported and may break unexpectedly between releases.\nCurrently supported OCI Distribution version: v1.0.0\nSpecifying the Configuration Directory\nUsing Host Namespace Configs with CTR\nWhen pulling a container image via ctr using the --hosts-dir option tells ctr\nto find and use the host configuration files located in the specified path:\nctr images pull --hosts-dir \"/etc/containerd/certs.d\" myregistry.io:5000/image_name:tag\nCRI\nThe old CRI config pattern for specifying registry.mirrors and registry.configs has\nbeen DEPRECATED. You should now point your registry config_path to the path where your\nhosts.toml files are located.\nModify your config.toml (default location: /etc/containerd/config.toml) as follows:\nversion = 2\n\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".registry]\n   config_path = \"/etc/containerd/certs.d\"\n\nSupport for Docker's Certificate File Pattern\nIf no hosts.toml configuration exists in the host directory, it will fallback to check\ncertificate files based on Docker's certificate file pattern\n(\".crt\" files for CA certificates and \".cert\"/\".key\" files for client certificates).\nRegistry Host Namespace\nA registry host is the location where container images and artifacts are sourced.  These\nregistry hosts may be local or remote and are typically accessed via http/https using the\nOCI distribution specification.\nA registry mirror is not a registry host but these mirrors can also be used to pull content.\nRegistry hosts are typically referred to by their internet domain names, aka. registry\nhost names. For example, docker.io, quay.io, gcr.io, and ghcr.io.\nA registry host namespace is, for the purpose of containerd registry configuration, a\npath to the hosts.toml file specified by the registry host name, or ip address, and an\noptional port identifier. When making a pull request for an image the format is\ntypically as follows:\npull [registry_host_name|IP address][:port][/v2][/org_path][:tag|@DIGEST]\nThe registry host namespace portion is [registry_host_name|IP address][:port]. Example\ntree for docker.io:\n$ tree /etc/containerd/certs.d\n/etc/containerd/certs.d\n└── docker.io\n    └── hosts.toml\nOptionally the _default registry host namespace can be used as a fallback, if no\nother namespace matches.\nThe /v2 portion of the pull request format shown above refers to the version of the\ndistribution api. If not included in the pull request, /v2 is added by default for all\nclients compliant to the distribution specification linked above.\nFor example when pulling image_name:tag from a private registry named myregistry.io over\nport 5000:\npull myregistry.io:5000/image_name:tag\nThe pull will resolve to https://myregistry.io:5000/v2/image_name:tag\nSpecifying Registry Credentials\nCTR\nWhen performing image operations via ctr use the --help option to get a list of options you can set for specifying credentials:\nctr i pull --help\n...\nOPTIONS:\n   --skip-verify, -k                 skip SSL certificate validation\n   --plain-http                      allow connections using plain HTTP\n   --user value, -u value            user[:password] Registry user and password\n   --refresh value                   refresh token for authorization server\n   --hosts-dir value                 Custom hosts configuration directory\n   --tlscacert value                 path to TLS root CA\n   --tlscert value                   path to TLS client certificate\n   --tlskey value                    path to TLS client key\n   --http-dump                       dump all HTTP request/responses when interacting with container registry\n   --http-trace                      enable HTTP tracing for registry interactions\n   --snapshotter value               snapshotter name. Empty value stands for the default value. [$CONTAINERD_SNAPSHOTTER]\n   --label value                     labels to attach to the image\n   --platform value                  Pull content from a specific platform\n   --all-platforms                   pull content and metadata from all platforms\n   --all-metadata                    Pull metadata for all platforms\n   --print-chainid                   Print the resulting image's chain ID\n   --max-concurrent-downloads value  Set the max concurrent downloads for each pull (default: 0)\nCRI\nAlthough we have deprecated the old CRI config pattern for specifying registry.mirrors\nand registry.configs you can still specify your credentials via\nCRI config.\nAdditionally, the containerd CRI plugin implements/supports the authentication parameters passed in through CRI pull image service requests.\nFor example, when containerd is the container runtime implementation for Kubernetes, the containerd CRI plugin receives\nauthentication credentials from kubelet as retrieved from\nKubernetes Image Pull Secrets\nRegistry Configuration - Examples\nSimple (default) Host Config for Docker\nHere is a simple example for a default registry hosts configuration.

This removes the need for the common pattern of using nested containers to achieve this separation.\nConsumers are able to have containers with the same names but with settings and/or configurations that vary drastically.\nFor example, system or infrastructure level containers can be hidden in one namespace while user level containers are kept in another.\nUnderlying image content is still shared via content addresses but image names and metadata are separate per namespace.\nIt is important to note that namespaces, as implemented, is an administrative construct that is not meant to be used as a security feature.\nIt is trivial for clients to switch namespaces.\nWho specifies the namespace?\nThe client specifies the namespace via the context.\nThere is a github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces package that allows a user to get and set the namespace on a context.\n// set a namespace\nctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), \"my-namespace\")\n\n// get the namespace\nns, ok := namespaces.Namespace(ctx)\n\nBecause the client calls containerd's gRPC API to interact with the daemon, all API calls require a context with a namespace set.\n\nNote that a namespace cannot be named \"version\" (#6944).\n\nHow low level is the implementation?\nNamespaces are passed through the containerd API to the underlying plugins providing functionality.\nPlugins must be written to take namespaces into account.\nFilesystem paths, IDs, and other system level resources must be namespaced for a plugin to work properly.\nHow does multi-tenancy work?\nSimply create a new context and set your application's namespace on the context.\nMake sure to use a unique namespace for applications that does not conflict with existing namespaces.

It provides basic\nmechanisms for plugins to track the state of containers and to make\nlimited changes to their configuration.\nNRI itself is agnostic to the internal implementation details of any\ncontainer runtime. It provides an adaptation library which runtimes\nuse to integrate to and interact with NRI and plugins. In principle\nany NRI plugin should be able to work with NRI-enabled runtimes.\nFor a detailed description of NRI and its capabilities please take a\nlook at the NRI repository.\nContainerd NRI Integration\n\nsee the containerd/NRI integration diagram\n\n\n\nNRI support in containerd is split into two parts both logically and\nphysically. These parts are a common plugin (/nri/*) to integrate to\nNRI and CRI-specific bits (/pkg/cri/server/nri-api) which convert\ndata between the runtime-agnostic NRI representation and the internal\nrepresentation of the CRI plugin.\nContainerd NRI Plugin\nThe containerd common NRI plugin implements the core logic of integrating\nto and interacting with NRI. However, it does this without any knowledge\nabout the internal representation of containers or pods within containerd.\nIt defines an additional interface, Domain, which is used whenever the\ninternal representation of a container or pod needs to be translated to\nthe runtime agnostic NRI one, or when a configuration change requested by\nan external NRI plugin needs to be applied to a container within containerd. Domain can be considered as a short-cut name for Domain-Namespace as Domain implements the functions the generic NRI interface needs to deal with pods and containers from a particular containerd namespace. As a reminder, containerd namespaces isolate state between clients of containerd. E.g. \"k8s.io\" for the kubernetes CRI clients, \"moby\" for docker clients, ... and \"containerd\" as the default for containerd/ctr.\nNRI Support for CRI Containers\nThe containerd CRI plugin registers itself as an above mentioned NRI\nDomain for the \"k8s.io\" namespace, to allow container configuration to be customized by external\nNRI plugins. Currently this Domain interface is only implemented for\nthe original CRI pkg/cri/server implementation. Implementing it for\nthe more recent experimental pkg/cri/sbserver implementation is on\nthe TODO list.\nNRI Support for Other Container 'Domains'\nThe main reason for this split of functionality is to allow\n NRI plugins for other types of sandboxes and for other container clients other than just for CRI containers in the \"k8s.io\" namespace.\nEnabling NRI Support in Containerd\nEnabling and disabling NRI support in containerd happens by enabling or\ndisabling the common containerd NRI plugin. The plugin, and consequently\nNRI functionality, is disabled by default. It can be enabled by editing\nthe [plugins.\"io.containerd.nri.v1.nri\"] section in the containerd\nconfiguration file, which by default is /etc/containerd/config.toml,\nand changing disable = true to disable = false. Once enabled, the\nNRI section should look something like this:\n  [plugins.\"io.containerd.nri.v1.nri\"]\n    # Enable NRI support in containerd.\n    disable = false\n    # Allow connections from externally launched NRI plugins.\n    disable_connections = false\n    # plugin_config_path is the directory to search for plugin-specific configuration.\n    plugin_config_path = \"/etc/nri/conf.d\"\n    # plugin_path is the directory to search for plugins to launch on startup.\n    plugin_path = \"/opt/nri/plugins\"\n    # plugin_registration_timeout is the timeout for a plugin to register after connection.\n    plugin_registration_timeout = \"5s\"\n    # plugin_requst_timeout is the timeout for a plugin to handle an event/request.\n    plugin_request_timeout = \"2s\"\n    # socket_path is the path of the NRI socket to create for plugins to connect to.\n    socket_path = \"/var/run/nri/nri.sock\"\n\nThere are two ways how an NRI plugin can be started. Plugins can be\npre-registered in which case they are automatically started when the NRI\nadaptation is instantiated (or in our case when containerd is started).\nPlugins can also be started by external means, for instance by systemd.\nPre-registering a plugin happens by placing a symbolic link to the plugin\nexecutable into a well-known NRI-specific directory, /opt/nri/plugins\nby default. A pre-registered plugin is started with a socket pre-connected\nto NRI. Externally launched plugins connect to a well-known NRI-specific\nsocket, /var/run/nri/nri.sock by default, to register themselves. The only\ndifference between pre-registered and externally launched plugins is how\nthey get started and connected to NRI. Once a connection is established\nall plugins are identical.\nNRI can be configured to disable connections from externally launched\nplugins, in which case the well-known socket is not created at all. The\nconfiguration fragment shown above ensures that external connections are\nenabled regardless of the built-in NRI defaults. This is convenient for\ntesting as it allows one to connect, disconnect and reconnect plugins at\nany time.\nNote that you can't run two NRI-enabled runtimes on a single node with the\nsame default socket configuration. You need to either disable NRI or change\nthe NRI socket path in one of the runtimes.\nTesting NRI Support in Containerd\nYou can verify that NRI integration is properly enabled and functional by\nconfiguring containerd and NRI as described above, taking the NRI\nlogger plugin from the NRI repository\non github, compiling it and starting it up.\ngit clone https://github.com/containerd/nri\ncd nri\ngit checkout pr/proto/draft\nmake\n./build/bin/logger -idx 00\n\nYou should see the logger plugin receiving receiving a list of existing pods\nand containers. If you then create or remove further pods and containers\nusing crictl or kubectl you should see detailed logs of the corresponding NRI\nevents printed by the logger.\nNRI Compatibility With v0.1.0 Plugins\nYou can enable backward compatibility with NRI v0.1.0 plugins using the\nv010-adapter plugin.\ngit clone https://github.com/containerd/nri\ncd nri\nmake\nsudo cp build/bin/v010-adapter /usr/local/bin\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/nri/plugins\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/v010-adapter /opt/nri/plugins/00-v010-adapter\n\n"},"ops.html":{"url":"ops.html","title":"Ops","keywords":"","body":"containerd for Ops and Admins\ncontainerd is meant to be a simple daemon to run on any system.\nIt provides a minimal config with knobs to configure the daemon and what plugins are used when necessary.\nNAME:\n   containerd -\n                    __        _                     __\n  _________  ____  / /_____ _(_)___  ___  _________/ /\n / ___/ __ \\/ __ \\/ __/ __ `/ / __ \\/ _ \\/ ___/ __  /\n/ /__/ /_/ / / / / /_/ /_/ / / / / /  __/ /  / /_/ /\n\\___/\\____/_/ /_/\\__/\\__,_/_/_/ /_/\\___/_/   \\__,_/\n\nhigh performance container runtime\n\n\nUSAGE:\n   containerd [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\n\nVERSION:\n   v1.7.0-beta.0\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\ncontainerd is a high performance container runtime whose daemon can be started\nby using this command.

Because containerd will be managing multiple containers, we need to ensure that containers are killed before the containerd daemon gets into an out of memory condition.\nWe also do not want to make containerd unkillable, but we want to lower its score to the level of other system daemons.\ncontainerd also exports its own metrics as well as container level metrics via the Prometheus metrics format under /v1/metrics.\nCurrently, Prometheus only supports TCP endpoints, therefore, the metrics address should be a TCP address that your Prometheus infrastructure can scrape metrics from.\ncontainerd also has two different storage locations on a host system.\nOne is for persistent data and the other is for runtime state.\nroot will be used to store any type of persistent data for containerd.\nSnapshots, content, metadata for containers and image, as well as any plugin data will be kept in this location.\nThe root is also namespaced for plugins that containerd loads.\nEach plugin will have its own directory where it stores data.\ncontainerd itself does not actually have any persistent data that it needs to store, its functionality comes from the plugins that are loaded.\n/var/lib/containerd/\n├── io.containerd.content.v1.content\n│   ├── blobs\n│   └── ingest\n├── io.containerd.metadata.v1.bolt\n│   └── meta.db\n├── io.containerd.runtime.v2.task\n│   ├── default\n│   └── example\n├── io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.btrfs\n└── io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs\n    ├── metadata.db\n    └── snapshots\nstate will be used to store any type of ephemeral data.\nSockets, pids, runtime state, mount points, and other plugin data that must not persist between reboots are stored in this location.\n/run/containerd\n├── containerd.sock\n├── debug.sock\n├── io.containerd.runtime.v2.task\n│   └── default\n│       └── redis\n│           ├── config.json\n│           ├── init.pid\n│           ├── log.json\n│           └── rootfs\n│               ├── bin\n│               ├── data\n│               ├── dev\n│               ├── etc\n│               ├── home\n│               ├── lib\n│               ├── media\n│               ├── mnt\n│               ├── proc\n│               ├── root\n│               ├── run\n│               ├── sbin\n│               ├── srv\n│               ├── sys\n│               ├── tmp\n│               ├── usr\n│               └── var\n└── runc\n    └── default\n        └── redis\n            └── state.json\nBoth the root and state directories are namespaced for plugins.\nBoth directories are an implementation detail of containerd and its plugins.\nThey should not be tampered with as corruption and bugs can and will happen.\nExternal apps reading or watching changes in these directories have been known to cause EBUSY and stale file handles when containerd and/or its plugins try to cleanup resources.\nversion = 2\n\n# persistent data location\nroot = \"/var/lib/containerd\"\n# runtime state information\nstate = \"/run/containerd\"\n# set containerd's OOM score\noom_score = -999\n\n# grpc configuration\n[grpc]\n  address = \"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\"\n  # socket uid\n  uid = 0\n  # socket gid\n  gid = 0\n\n# debug configuration\n[debug]\n  address = \"/run/containerd/debug.sock\"\n  # socket uid\n  uid = 0\n  # socket gid\n  gid = 0\n  # debug level\n  level = \"info\"\n\n# metrics configuration\n[metrics]\n  # tcp address!\n  address = \"127.0.0.1:1234\"\n\nPlugin Configuration\nAt the end of the day, containerd's core is very small.\nThe real functionality comes from plugins.\nEverything from snapshotters, runtimes, and content are all plugins that are registered at runtime.\nBecause these various plugins are so different we need a way to provide type safe configuration to the plugins.\nThe only way we can do this is via the config file and not CLI flags.\nIn the config file you can specify plugin level options for the set of plugins that you use via the [plugins.] sections.\nYou will have to read the plugin specific docs to find the options that your plugin accepts.\nSee containerd's Plugin documentation\nBolt Metadata Plugin\nThe bolt metadata plugin allows configuration of the content sharing policy between namespaces.\nThe default mode \"shared\" will make blobs available in all namespaces once it is pulled into any namespace.\nThe blob will be pulled into the namespace if a writer is opened with the \"Expected\" digest that is already present in the backend.\nThe alternative mode, \"isolated\" requires that clients prove they have access to the content by providing all of the content to the ingest before the blob is added to the namespace.\nBoth modes share backing data, while \"shared\" will reduce total bandwidth across namespaces, at the cost of allowing access to any blob just by knowing its digest.\nThe default is \"shared\". While this is largely the most desired policy, one can change to \"isolated\" mode with the following configuration:\nversion = 2\n\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.metadata.v1.bolt\"]\n    content_sharing_policy = \"isolated\"\n\nIn \"isolated\" mode, it is also possible to share only the contents of a specific namespace by adding the label containerd.io/namespace.shareable=true to that namespace.\nThis will make its blobs available in all other namespaces even if the content sharing policy is set to \"isolated\".\nIf the label value is set to anything other than true, the namespace content will not be shared.\n"},"PLUGINS.html":{"url":"PLUGINS.html","title":"PLUGINS","keywords":"","body":"containerd Plugins\ncontainerd supports extending its functionality using most of its defined\ninterfaces.

snapshotters to reuse snapshots existing somewhere managed by them.\nRemote Snapshotter is a snapshotter that leverages this functionality and reuses snapshots that are stored in a remotely shared place.\nThese remotely shared snapshots are called remote snapshots.\nRemote snapshotter allows containerd to prepare these remote snapshots without pulling layers from registries, which hopefully shorten the time to take for image pull.\nOne of the remote snapshotter implementations is Stargz Snapshotter.\nThis enables containerd to lazily pull images from standard-compliant registries leveraging remote snapshotter functionality and stargz images by google/crfs.\nThe containerd client API\nThe containerd client's Pull API with unpacking-mode allows the underlying snapshotter to query for remote snapshots before fetching content.\nRemote snapshotter needs to be plugged into containerd in the same ways as normal snapshotters.\nimage, err := client.Pull(ctx, ref,\n    containerd.WithPullUnpack,\n    containerd.WithPullSnapshotter(\"my-remote-snapshotter\"),\n)\n\nPassing snapshotter-specific information\nSome remote snapshotters requires snapshotter-specific information through Pull API.\nThe information will be used in various ways including searching snapshot contents from a remote store.\nOne of the example snapshotters that requires snapshotter-specific information is stargz snapshotter.\nIt requires the image reference name and layer digests, etc. for searching layer contents from registries.\nSnapshotters receive the information through user-defined labels prefixed by containerd.io/snapshot/.\nThe containerd client supports two ways to pass these labels to the underlying snapshotter.\nUsing snapshotter's WithLabels option\nUser-defined labels can be passed down to the underlying snapshotter using snapshotter option WithLabels.\nSpecified labels will be passed down every time the containerd client queries a remote snapshot.\nThis is useful if the values of these labels are determined statically regardless of the snapshots.\nThese user-defined labels must be prefixed by containerd.io/snapshot/.\nimport \"github.com/containerd/containerd/snapshots\"\n\nimage, err := client.Pull(ctx, ref,\n    containerd.WithPullUnpack,\n    containerd.WithPullSnapshotter(\n

WithImageHandlerWrapper option\nUser-defined labels can also be passed using an image handler wrapper.\nThis is useful when labels vary depending on the snapshot.\nEvery time the containerd client queries remote snapshot, it passes Annotations appended to the targeting layer descriptor (means the layer descriptor that will be pulled and unpacked for preparing that snapshot) to the underlying snapshotter.\nThese annotations are passed to the snapshotter as user-defined labels.\nThe values of annotations can be dynamically added and modified in the handler wrapper.\nNote that annotations must be prefixed by containerd.io/snapshot/.\ngithub.com/containerd/containerd/pkg/snapshotters is a handler implementation used by the CRI package, nerdctl and moby.\nimport \"github.com/containerd/containerd/pkg/snapshotters\"\n\nif _, err := client.Pull(ctx, ref,\n    containerd.WithPullUnpack,\n    containerd.WithPullSnapshotter(\"my-remote-snapshotter\"),\n    containerd.WithImageHandlerWrapper(snapshotters.AppendInfoHandlerWrapper(ref)),\n)\n\nSnapshotter APIs for querying remote snapshots\nThe containerd client queries remote snapshots to the underlying remote snapshotter using snapshotter APIs.\nThis section describes the high-level overview of how snapshotter APIs are used for remote snapshots functionality, with some piece of pseudo-codes that describe the simplified logic implemented in the containerd client.\nFor more details, see unpacker.go that implements this logic.\nDuring image pull, the containerd client calls Prepare API with the label containerd.io/snapshot.ref.\nThis is a containerd-defined label which contains ChainID that targets a committed snapshot that the client is trying to prepare.\nAt this moment, user-defined labels (prefixed by containerd.io/snapshot/) will also be merged into the labels option.\n// Gets annotations appended to the targeting layer which would contain\n// snapshotter-specific information passed by the user.\nlabels := snapshots.FilterInheritedLabels(desc.Annotations)\nif labels == nil {\n    labels = make(map[string]string)\n}\n\n// Specifies ChainID of the targeting committed snapshot.\nlabels[\"containerd.io/snapshot.ref\"] = chainID\n\n// Merges snapshotter options specified by the user which would contain\n// snapshotter-specific information passed by the user.\nopts := append(rCtx.SnapshotterOpts, snapshots.WithLabels(labels))\n\n// Calls `Prepare` API with target identifier and snapshotter-specific\n// information.\nmounts, err = sn.Prepare(ctx, key, parent.String(), opts...)\n\nIf this snapshotter is a remote snapshotter, that committed snapshot hopefully exists, for example, in a shared remote store.\nRemote snapshotter must define and enforce policies about whether it will use an existing snapshot.\nWhen remote snapshotter allows the user to use that snapshot, it must return ErrAlreadyExists.\nIf the containerd client gets ErrAlreadyExists by Prepare, it ensures the existence of that committed snapshot by calling Stat with the ChainID.\nIf this snapshot is available, the containerd client skips pulling and unpacking layer that would otherwise be needed for preparing and committing that snapshot.\nmounts, err = sn.Prepare(ctx, key, parent.String(), opts...)\nif err != nil {\n    if errdefs.IsAlreadyExists(err) {\n        // Ensures the layer existence\n        if _, err := sn.Stat(ctx, chainID); err != nil {\n            // Handling error\n        } else {\n            // snapshot found with ChainID\n            // pulling/unpacking will be skipped\n            continue\n        }\n    } else {\n        return err\n

The flexible API allows each implementation of the transfer interface to determines whether the transfer between the source and destination is possible. This allows new functionality to be added directly by implementations without versioning the API or requiring other implementations to handle an interface change.\nThe transfer service is built upon the core ideas put forth by the libchan project, that an API with binary streams and data channels as first class objects is more flexible and opens a wider variety of use cases without requiring constant protocol and API updates. To accomplish this, the transfer service makes use of the streaming service to allow binary and object streams to be accessible by transfer objects even when using grpc and ttrpc.\nTransfer API\nThe transfer API consists of a single operation which can be called with various different objects depending on the intended operation.\nIn Go the API looks like,\ntype Transferrer interface {\n    Transfer(ctx context.Context, source interface{}, destination interface{}, opts ...Opt) error\n}\n\nThe proto API looks like,\nservice Transfer {\n    rpc Transfer(TransferRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);\n}\n\nmessage TransferRequest {\n    google.protobuf.Any source = 1;\n    google.protobuf.Any destination = 2;\n    // + options\n}\n\nTransfer Objects (Sources and Destinations)\nTransfer Operations\n\n\n\nSource\nDestination\nDescription\nLocal Implementation Version\n\n\n\n\nRegistry\nImage Store\n\"pull\"\n1.7\n\n\nImage Store\nRegistry\n\"push\"\n1.7\n\n\nObject stream (Archive)\nImage Store\n\"import\"\n1.7\n\n\nImage Store\nObject stream (Archive)\n\"export\"\n1.7 (in progress)\n\n\nObject stream (Layer)\nMount/Snapshot\n\"unpack\"\nNot implemented\n\n\nMount/Snapshot\nObject stream (Layer)\n\"diff\"\nNot implemented\n\n\nImage Store\nImage Store\n\"tag\"\nNot implemented\n\n\nRegistry\nRegistry\nmirror registry image\nNot implemented\n\n\n\nLocal containerd daemon support\ncontainerd has a single built in transfer plugin which implements most basic transfer operations.

The streaming protocol should be invisible to the client Go interface. Object types such as funcs, readers, and writers can be transparently converted to the streaming protocol when going over RPC. The client and server interface can remain unchanged while the proto marshaling and unmarshaling need to be aware of the streaming protocol and have access to the stream manager. Streams are created by clients using the client side stream manager and sent via proto RPC as string stream identifiers. Server implementations of services can lookup the streams by the stream identifier using the server side stream manager.\nProgress\nProgress is an asynchronous callback sent from the server to the client. It is normally representing in the Go interface as a simple callback function, which the the client implements and the server calls.\nFrom Go types progress uses these types\ntype ProgressFunc func(Progress)\n\ntype Progress struct {\n    Event    string\n    Name     string\n    Parents  []string\n    Progress int64\n    Total    int64\n}\n\nThe proto message type sent over the stream is\nmessage Progress {\n    string event = 1;\n    string name = 2;\n    repeated string parents = 3;\n    int64 progress = 4;\n    int64 total = 5;\n}\n\nProgress can be passed along as a transfer option to get progress on any transfer operation. The progress events may differ based on the transfer operation.\nBinary Streams\nTransfer objects may also use io.Reader and io.WriteCloser directly.\nThe bytes are transferred over the stream using two simple proto message types\nmessage Data {\n    bytes data = 1;\n}\n\nmessage WindowUpdate {\n    int32 update = 1;\n}\n\nThe sender sends the Data message and the receiver sends the WindowUpdate message. When the client is sending an io.Reader, the client is the sender and server is the receiver. When a client sends an io.WriteCloser, the server is the sender and the client is the receiver.\nBinary streams are used for import (sending an io.Reader) and export (sending an io.WriteCloser).\nCredentials\nCredentials are handled as a synchronous callback from the server to the client. The callback is made when the server encounters an authorization request from a registry.\nThe Go interface to use a credential helper in a transfer object looks like\ntype CredentialHelper interface {\n    GetCredentials(ctx context.Context, ref, host string) (Credentials, error)\n}\n\ntype Credentials struct {\n    Host     string\n    Username string\n    Secret   string\n    Header   string\n}\n\nIt is send over a stream using the proto messages\n// AuthRequest is sent as a callback on a stream\nmessage AuthRequest {\n    // host is the registry host\n    string host = 1;\n\n    // reference is the namespace and repository name requested from the registry\n    string reference = 2;\n\n    // wwwauthenticate is the HTTP WWW-Authenticate header values returned from the registry\n    repeated string wwwauthenticate = 3;\n}\n\nenum AuthType {\n    NONE = 0;\n\n    // CREDENTIALS is used to exchange username/password for access token\n    // using an oauth or \"Docker Registry Token\" server\n    CREDENTIALS = 1;\n\n    // REFRESH is used to exchange secret for access token using an oauth\n    // or \"Docker Registry Token\" server\n    REFRESH = 2;\n\n    // HEADER is used to set the HTTP Authorization header to secret\n    // directly for the registry.\n    // Value should be ` `\n    HEADER = 3;\n}\n\nmessage AuthResponse {\n    AuthType authType = 1;\n    string secret = 2;\n    string username = 3;\n    google.protobuf.Timestamp expire_at = 4;\n}\n\n"}}}
